It is not too dark and not too mild either and it has a really distinct flavor which you will love! The only thing is that it is kind of expensive (to buy it all at once) only not when you consider what it would cost in the store in those 12 ounce bags! that would come to about $6.80 a bag, so really it's NOT a bad price! I'm going to have to get some more!"", ""Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase."", ""I bought this tea as a gift for someone who had it at a tea and liked it. Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better. You may be very underwhelmed by this tea compared to them.""]"

He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog liked it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Resealable Ziploc style bag.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, animal digest, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), garlic oil, menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- $22 is a bit expensive for a 15.5lb bag.  This food is often much cheaper at big box retailers and grocery stores.<br /><br />- Bag is plastic and currently not recyclable.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality."", 'My dog had a good result with this food, but it wasn\'t what I expected. My veterinarian wanted my dog to lose weight because my dog had no indentation at his waist or under his belly.  I tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4"">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, but his physique never improved and his weight never went down. For both weight-loss foods, I used a calorie-determination formula instead of the feeding guides. For both foods, the feeding guides on the bags recommended a lot more food than the formula (see formula at end of review.)<br /><br />Many dogs will not drink enough to process a very high protein dog food like Premium Edge (49% protein) even when fresh water is offerred. I suspect dogs may limit their drinking to accommodate a potty schedule.  At  my dog\'s 2 daily feedings, I add  enough warm water to just cover his kibble. (When I first added the water, my dog had accidents because I feed him after his morning exercise walk.  I had to change his feeding to 30 minutes before his walk.)  I let the food it soak on the counter for 2 minutes, and then I stir in 2 heaping table-spoons of low-sodium canned green beans (10 cals.)  My dog eats the food with gusto and seems to feel full after he eats. He begs less and is happy with small treats. On the other weight-loss food, he was acting full at first but, after a few weeks, he began begging for food right after he ate, even with the water and green beans.<br /><br />I also should say that I walked my dog about a mile per day on both weight-loss foods.<br /><br />When the vet saw my dog 6 weeks after switching to Premium Edge, I though he was going to tell me to go back to my dog\'s old food because, on my scale at home, he gained 3 pounds.  I was so frustrated.  To my surprise, the vet told me that my dog was in excellent condition.  The weight gain was due to higher muscle mass! His waist and belly were not flabby at all anymore. I guess the high-protein levels in this food are giving my dog what he needs to grow muscle, and the increase in muscle mass enables him to burn the fat more efficiently. He may have been so hungry on the other food because he needed more protein. I am so happy with the results that I am continuing to feed my dog the same food at the same amount indefinitely. He is still very satisfied with his food.<br /><br />If you are not willing to exerise your dog every day, I don\'t know if you will get this result, but I think it is a fabulous food if you are committed to walking your dog a long way each day, rain or shine.  It is an economical yet high-quality food.<br /><br />At 49%, this is the highest-protein in a dry dog food I have ever seen. Not even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XGDG"">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Salmon Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a>, which is grain-free,  comes close to this food in protein.  To get this much protein, I ordinarily would have to feed wet food.  There was no way I could afford wet food for my dog--it would cost $120 per month to feed my dog a quality, high-protein wet food. For a low-quality (and lower protein) wet food, it would cost $45/month, whereas Premium Edge dry food costs me about $25/month.<br /><br />In addition, this food is high in fibre, grain-free, low fat, and contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, probiotics, and chelated minerals (which are more bio-available than minerals that are not ""chelated"" to protein.) At 347 calories per cup, it is it is as low in calories as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4"">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, but Premium Edge has more than twice the protein and no calories from grains.<br /><br />As with every dog food label I have ever read, the feeding guide on Premium Edge over-feeds the dog.  If I followed the instructions on the Premium Edge bag, I would be feeding 2 1/4 cups per day. According to Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, the calories a dog should consume to lose weight is computed as follows: (1)Determine your dog\'s ""ideal"" weight with your vet or by looking up your dog\'s breed (or predominant breed) with the AKC. If your dog ever appeared to be a healthy weight, you can use that past weight as an ideal weight. Convert his ideal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2. For my dog, 44 lbs over 2.2= 20 (2) Multiply her weight in KG by 30. For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog\'s case, 600+70=670 calories per day. This food is 347 calories per cup, so 670/347 = 1.93 cups per day is the most my dog should be fed. The Premium Edge feeding guide recommends 2 1/4 cups per day, which is 781 calories.  A small difference in serving size makes a difference of over 100 calories.  Ironically, my dog is well-above his 44 lb ""ideal"" weight, but he is at a new ""ideal"" weight with heavy muscle mass.', ""I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.""]"

I was expecting berries, but could not quite identify the flavor when I tasted the first bar. I noticed that the bars are crunchy, not too sweet, and have a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />After, getting over my surprise at the taste, I read the list of ingredients. The ""berry\' flavor is actually cherry. Also, there is cocoa in the bars. The sugar content is low, about one-quarter. Many granola bars are one-third or more sugar, which makes them softer and sweeter.<br /><br />I have come to like these bars. The taste reminds me of chocolate-covered cherries. This product is not for those who have a sweet tooth. However, I prefer the low sugar content. They make a good afternoon snack. The price is good, just over twenty dollars for six packages of five bars, or thirty bars.', 'When I first bit into one of these bars I was expecting it to taste very sweet, but it is not real sweet like a candy bar.

Could taste better with more sugar, but I think it is better just like it is.', ""This bar is a very nice snack! The bar is not hard or dry like most granola bars, but is not too soft either. This is a very delightful & chewy granola bar that has a nice size to it!<br /><br />The bar itself looks to be composed mostly of nuts. I first expected something closer to a payday candy bar for flavor, but that changed when I ate one of these Planters Big Triple Nut bars. These bars are not simply just a bunch of peanuts, or plain old granola bars. It is a wonderful blend of both with a nice honey flavor.<br /><br />I enjoyed these bars and find them to be a useful snack when I am a little hungry, but don't have time to eat yet. A much better alternative to a sugar filled candy bar. Also, they are excellently priced! Each 8.1 Ounce box has 5 bars, each weighing in at 1.6 oz ... so, you get 50 bars! Not bad!""]"

At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.

No matter how much I seemed to spend on what passes for ""regular"" cat foods she looked terrible.<br /><br />It is definitely a dense food, but that just means I fill up the bowl less often - usually once a day, down from two or more when my younger cat was eating constantly because the food I gave them had so little real food in it!  From the way my cats\' condition has improved, it appears to be a very healthy food as well.  I saw the difference in my Siamese mix\'s coat less than a week after switching from what was basically fish flavored corn cereal to this - her coat is shiny again and she has definitely gained back some weight on Blue Wilderness.  My cats will push each other out of the way to have the first bite after their bowl is empty.  My picky eater even eats Blue Wilderness kibble straight from the floor if it\'s given as a treat.<br /><br />I have tried several other ""holistic"" and ""real food"" cat foods, but this one is definitely the most preferred by me (Amazon.com makes it very affordable compared to my local pet stores) and my two cats.

Blue Wilderness strikes a nice balance.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />When I got my new kitten recently (that makes three cats total now), I noticed that Blue Wilderness is now making a kitten formula of this food (not yet available on Amazon.)  I picked some up at a local Petsmart for the new arrival.

I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry.

If you are looking for food for an older kid with eating issues/food aversions/texture issues etc... they are smooth as regular apple sauce, but the flavor made my son spit it out.  I thought they tasted good, but I\'m not the one with the food aversions (or at least not the same ones)...  My son did eat plenty of green veggies as an infant that he won\'t touch now (even if pureed), so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Our family regularly consumes more of these baby food ""pouches"" and fruit sauce ""pouches"" than I imagine most families who have an actual baby at the suggested ""stage"".  My son has autism and has quite a few issues with eating so not only does something have to taste good, it has to be uniform in consistency, and it has to look and smell acceptable to him.  He is 8 and he will eat baby food puree (Earth\'s best in the little glass jars) that doesn\'t have any ""gummable"" chunks that older babies usually get.  Add in that we have G6PD Deficiency and follow strict dietary rules and there are few ""convenience"" foods that are suited to our needs...<br />My son adores the Revolution Foods pouches but will not touch home-made apple sauce (even if hidden in reused baby food jars)... Some of the Ella\'s Kitchen pouches he adores and others he hated so much that he will go through the entire fridge shelf of pouches just to make sure none of those flavors have infiltrated...<br /><br />I was hoping that this Baby Gourmet Simple Puree Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pouch would be a great way to get some Broccoli and other green goodies in his belly.  They do have some added ascorbic acid, which is contraindicated in high doses for folks with G6PD deficiency, but I calculated the potential dose and for us (your mileage may vary and you should consult your pediatrician or hematologist about ascorbic acid and any other contraindicated substances) it was ok.  My spouse joined us in the pouch taste test.<br /><br />I think they taste good- like pear-apple sauce with a hint of broccoli/greens.  It kind of reminded me of when my mom would serve us pork chops and potatoes, apple sauce, and spinach for dinner when I was a kid (sans the pork chops).... My husband thought they were just as good as any of the other ones we have tried.<br /><br />My kid took two slurps of it and ran to the toilet to spit it out.  He declared that it tastes like the apple sauce went bad.  I disagree, but as far as what purees come into our house, his opinion is very important.  I think that if I diluted one of these with two regular apple sauces it might ""dampen"" the loudness of the veggies enough for him to eat it but I\'m not even sure about that.  To me the green flavors weren\'t that ""loud"" but they definitely made this ""not pearsauce/applesauce blend""...  Definitely not a ""sneaky chef"" sort of food for our family, but I\'ll probably try other flavors out as they are still an extra little boost of goodness for adults on the run.', ""I have an 11 month and 3.5 year old. These pouches make for a great yummy snack. My kids love to eat them right out of the pouch. My older child eats her whole veggies and also these pouches. My baby, is not a huge veggie fan like my eldest.. she loves these however. When I cook for the baby if I don't hide the veggies well, she will reject the meal. So, when I can't get my baby to eat the organic veggies I have made or when I need a quick snack while shopping or out and about, Ella's takes great care of us! Def a must have. Oh, I just give my baby the whole tube and she sucks it all out.. great for the baby who had always refused me feeding her.""]"

He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor."", ""It took my 4 month old Westie a week to figure out how this toy worked, but now he can get most of the kibble out in about 10 mins. It is a great toy and it definitely keeps his attention.  The one I have has an actual rope and not a rubber rope, so it has lasted. He has managed to chew off a few of the spikes on the rubber ball. Some end up on the floor and some in his tummy. I think the toy might be better if it didn't even have the spikes on it, so I wouldn't have to worry about him eating them. Overall it is a great toy and the jug seems very durable."", ""We have both a medium and a large version of this toy.  We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months.  Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole.  As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it.  It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it.  After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.<br /><br />I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up.  Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play.  This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with.  If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it.  Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.<br /><br />One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy.  In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.<br /><br />In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy.""]"

I cannot give this product 5 stars only because I cannot say what long term effect it is having on his teeth because he's only 2 so has good health all around.  I wasn't sure if he would like these treats as the common complaint in the other reviews seems to be that some cats just wont touch them.  However, since the treat is pretty similar to a wine cork I would suggest you see first if your cat will play with one (our cat loves batting corks all over the house).

Unfortunately, it leaves a lot of crumbs, which a lot of people will probably hate, but, lucky for me, my cats are very clean and thorough so it hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Now, I know that other people are saying that the large size is a negative feature of these treats, but, really, it's not. If they were smaller, they may just be swallowed whole instead. That's what one my cats does with her food and other treats. Because of the size of these treats, though, she's forced to chew them, which is good since these are dental treats. They have to be chewed to be effective.<br /><br />The flavor of these treats must be really good too. My cats are usually very open to sharing food and treats with one another, but when it comes to these treats, they growl if the other tries to even sneak a crumb.<br /><br />Before I bought these, I thought about buying the ones by Petrodex. After I compared the ingredients, though, I realized these were the way to go. Petrodex has two additional ingredients. The first one I googled turns out to be poisonous to cats.

I made this into Fettucini Alfredo with chicken and it was amazing. The key is to prep the noodles correctly to remove the aroma. Once you do this, the noodles will take on the flavors of your food. They work best with heavy or deeply flavored sauces. I cooked my noodles with the chicken and mushroom drippings before I added the jarred sauce. So good. All those crusty chicken brown bits just infused the noodles to 5 STAR food......So Good.<br /><br />I have also made them into ramen style soup (again, strong flavorful liquid to infuse the noodles) and it was great too, but I prefer the Spagetti size for ramen. SImple as cake. I will usually make my own soup base (Soy sauce, mirin, sake, beef stock, garlic) but If I am being lazy, I will snatch a flavor packet from a dry ramen baggy (A 0.19 cent sacrifice for Maruchan Ramen in Beef flavor, toss the uber fattening palm oil fried trans fat noodles) and cook my noodles in that broth.<br /><br />To prep the noodles for any application, you must drain, rinse, and dunk in boiling water for like 30 seconds to remove the odor and then set aside until needed.

For some reason these so drinks do not keep me up or give me that boost or whatever. Still that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy the taste of said products. When it comes to this one it is a bit sweet but overall it tastes pretty good. It is the usual 16 oz can full of energy and taste for most people. I would recommend this to people that are fans of energy drinks."", 'Of all the energy solutions out there, this is easily the best one.  However, it still has its drawbacks.<br /><br />First, the PROs -<br /><br />Instant energy - Works almost immediately (within 1 minute for me)<br /><br />Not a lot of ""jitter"" - Many other energy bars and drinks give you that shaky feeling.  This one does not<br /><br />No Crash - Its true, there is no crash.  Though when you come back to your previous energy level, it might feel like a crash.<br /><br />A very positive energy - In addition to the physical energy you also get a very refreshing mental energy.  It can almost be described as a very focused high.  A feeling of clarity and motivation all at once<br /><br />Small amount goes a long way - I like that you dont have to drink a big 16 oz bottle of this stuff.  Most energy drinks have a taste about as appealing as bath water.  So, its nice to only have to drink an oz or two<br /><br />Now, for the CONS<br /><br />Taste - See above<br /><br />Thirst - I get very thirsty on this stuff.  I always have to make sure to have a big bottle of water around<br /><br />Its addictive - The ""mental"" energy you get from this makes you want to do it all over again.  Probably not for people with addictive personalities<br /><br />Big initial blast - The first 10 minutes for me are almost too much.  I seem to want to do everything all at once.  After that, i calm down a bit and become intensely focused.  But, those first 10 minutes are usually spent just trying not to knock anything over in my office', 'I\'ve tried quite a few energy drinks, mints and pills and have favorites in each area.  5-Hour Energy isn\'t my personal favorite as far as energy drinks go, but it is quite exceptional.  When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night\'s sleep.  I wasn\'t going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn\'t going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It\'s somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to ""take it up a notch"" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice.']"

The key to using this sauce is MODERATION! If you use too much you will be begging for mercy. But when you get it right, it puts just the right amount of heat to get your scalp tingling but not so bad that it takes away from the taste of what your cooking. This is excellent when mixed with chili or your favorite BBQ sauce. Look, anyone can make something hot but if it's so hot you can't taste the food then whats the purpose? This sauce allows you to add heat to your dish and still allows you to taste your dish as long as you learn to add a drop at a time until you find your tolerence level. REMEMBER your tolerence level is not the same as everyone else's! One of the great things about this sauce is you have to use so little that a single bottle will last a long time!<br /><br />Well worth the price and highly recommended. However, one word of CAUTION as with any hot sauce, when you handle or cook with this sauce be sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. When adding this sauce while cooking, the vapors will contain this sauce and get on your hands. Even hours after cooking, if you don't wash your hands and you happen to rub your eyes, you will regret it!<br /><br />The best thing to me about this sauce is it can be added during cooking or afterwards. Either way though, you have to remember to use it in moderation and treat it like a loaded weapon! It really is a great sauce in my opinion!"", ""I came across a bottle of this sauce and picked it up because my husband loves hot sauces. I don't like sauces that are so hot that you can't really taste the sauce. If I want to burn my tongue I'll use a lighter! I was pleasantly surprised at how much flavor this has. It is very hot right out of the bottle but not so hot that you can't enjoy the flavor. I add a little bit almost everything.<br /> I am almost out and can't find it again locally. I am so glad that Amazon carries it. Try mixing and heating a can of jellied cranberry sauce, a jar of chile sauce and about a TBSP of this sauce. Pour it over cooked meatballs and simmer in a crock pot. Great for parties. This sauce puts it over the top. Want to kick up hot wings? Add some of this to wimpy Tabasco sauce! This is hands down the best hot sauce I have ever tried. You cannot lose with this one!"", 'I was first introduced to this sauce about 3 years ago, and it has ever since been a staple in my house.<br /><br />This is a rather mild Habanero sauce showcasing flavor over heat, but the heat is definitely there if you are more sensitive to spicy foods.<br /><br />The flavor of this sauce is a blend of Habaneros, carrots, onions, lime juice and garlic making a balanced ""sauce"" flavor that does not necessarily showcase the pepper quite as much as other hot sauces.  This is actually what I really like about this sauce because this makes it very useful as a condiment.<br /><br />I have recommended this sauce to everyone I know, and even given (and received) it as gifts.  I can not recommend a sauce any higher, this is a top notch product.']"

It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!<br /><br />Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"", 'The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn\'t want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I\'ve noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn\'t a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don\'t want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that\'s the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn\'t take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon\'s New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn\'t in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it\'s thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you\'re interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I\'m beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don\'t get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle\'s ears, at no extra charge!  (I\'ll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

So in the end, 6 cups of water and 40 minutes was best for me.<br /><br />I have to say, even without any flavoring (honey, nuts, cinnamon, etc), the oats taste really good.<br /><br />For consumption, I added some skim milk, drop of honey, and walnuts.

I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.

I LOVE their Classic Granola -- it\'s probably my favorite ""plain"" granola, perfect mixed with peach yogurt or eaten with milk.  Their Summer Berry Blend cereal was, to me, wayyy too sweet and the flakes were thick and hard.  I\'m sure someone somewhere will absolutely love it, but it wasn\'t for me.<br /><br />This Chocolate Delight Granola is somewhere in the middle.  It works great as a cereal, eaten with milk.  The flavor is reminiscent of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  The sweetness level was just about right, and the amount of chocolate was nice.  I\'m not sure I\'d want to eat it for breakfast, but for a snack, this works great.  I also tried it mixed with vanilla yogurt.  I used a 6-oz carton of vanilla yogurt, and added about 1/3 C of granola.  This worked well, too.<br /><br />Straight out of the box -- this doesn\'t work for me.  The chocolate chips have a sort of off-putting texture that seems to disappear with milk.  The cereal is kind of crumbly, so you don\'t have a huge amount of large clusters to grab onto.<br /><br />So, if you\'re looking for a ""snacking"" granola that you can nibble right out of the box, this might not be what you\'re looking for.  But if you\'re looking for a tasty chocolate, relatively healthy, granola to eat with milk or yogurt, this stuff is pretty darned good.', 'There\'s a difference between all-natural and organic.  Poisonous mushrooms are all-natural, proving that foods that boast about naturalness aren\'t necessarily all that impressive.  Organic means that the food is made from some of the healthiest ingredients available, and this granola is organic.<br /><br />Now, while we\'ve established that this granola is healthy, there\'s still the issue of taste.  Too often, organic food is extraordinarily healthy but tastes like cardboard coated with mud.  Thankfully, that is not the case with Love Crunch!  My taste buds tingled with every tantalizing bite of this delectable granola, and I could rest assured that I was getting a good source of fiber and many other nutrients.  There were chunks of dark chocolate and berries mingling with the granola clusters that would excite my tongue even more when I would munch on one of those.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have stated that they found this to be more of a snack food than a breakfast food; honestly, I would use it for both.  I found that I was reaching for this in the morning more often than my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52"">Cheerios Honey Nut Cereal</a>, however, there were also times when I would be snacking on it in the afternoon.  It\'s so good for any time of the day or any type of preparation.  If you like your granola with milk or yogurt, this will work very well for that.  I ate it plain most of the time, but it really can be used any way you would normally use granola, except for maybe baking.<br /><br />Overall, I love this stuff, and I will most likely be buying more soon.  It\'s probably most comparable to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6KBYE"">Special K Chocolatey Delight Cereal</a> but with healthier and more delicious ingredients (and granola instead of cereal flakes).

The main drawback is that there's nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle.  If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle's nozzle, you need to make a hole in it yourself.  This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can't really be cut with scissors.

It does really give off that ""hometown raw"" aesthetic though.<br /><br />Second - the consistency & color. My wife and I prefer raw honey and have tried various other brands (whole foods, farmers markets) and usually the consistency of the other brands is an extremely thick goo, which you have to spoon out. What\'s refreshing about this honey is how smooth it is. Another thing with the other brands of raw honey is the color. The other brands I\'ve tried have a dark amber color (resembles apple butter almost), however, this honey although slightly darker than regular grocery store bought honey, it still has a fairly normal color. My guess for the lighter color is attributed to the raw purity of this kind of honey.<br /><br />Third - and lastly the taste. This is the primary reason why I give this honey five stars. Although as I mentioned the packaging is a bit cumbersome, I\'d eat this honey if it came in a bowling ball. Well, maybe not, but you get the point. The taste is what matters. This honey is hands down the tastiest honey I\'ve ever had in my entire life. It\'s sweet but not overbearing and no bitter aftertaste like other honeys I\'ve tried. You MUST try this honey at least once in your life. It\'s refreshing to know that I no longer need to look anymore for great honey - I\'m a customer for life.', 'Well after some hours on the internet looking for a truly RAW honey I stumbled on this and decided why not give it a try.<br />After receiving it in the mail I realized that 23oz wasn\'t much at all, but I guess that\'s the price you pay for unheated, untreated honey these days.<br />With my first spoonful it was quite clear that this was honey was well above par. Consistency is great, not runny but not stone hard either; texture is smooth & soft, and taste is very unique for a honey. It tastes more like candy to me then actual honey. Very sweet, mild tasting. For some this may sit well but for me I was looking for something more ""earthy,"" more ""organic.""<br /><br />Bottomline: An excellent honey if you are interested in something RAW, SWEET tasting, & very MILDLY aromatic, but other then that I would recommend to others.<br /><br />Update: I recently picked up Stakich\'s Manuka Honey and I must say it\'s really a spectacular tasting honey, exactly the taste I was looking for, although the consistency was a bit more runny then I wanted.

With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature\'s One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby\'s Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA\'s Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby\'s Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby\'s Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby\'s Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby\'s Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby\'s Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby\'s Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child\'s healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you.

Iam lactose intolerant so I Figured she may be and tried many baby formulas including soy based. None of them helped until I Found the similac milk based lactose free formula(similac sensitive)My baby was so much more happy and her symptoms are gone. I have even switched back to other formulas to make sure and she always gets sick . My baby is only allowed to drink this formula are the lactaid milk that I drink.She is now one years old and wants no other type of milk. This is a very helpful formula.', ""We have been using this formula on our now fourth-month old for about 2 months now. I use it to supplement my breast milk supply which cannot always keep up with his increased need. It is excellent, as close to breast milk as you'll find I think. The only other brand I have tried is the Enfamil Premium Lipil they gave me at the hospital, used it early on when supply was getting established. He spat it up a little and hesistated to eat it but did when hungry, and it was some weird beige color. And it smelled weird too. I am sure it is fine, really, it is infant formula and safe I am sure. But I wanted to try something organic since that is what we mostly eat. I was really impressed with this formula and chose it over Earth's Best because of others' comments on the way the added DHA/ARA is extracted. Since this is only a supplement to my breast milk, he can get the DHA from that.<br /><br />As for use, I mix prepared Baby's Only formula with my breast milk and he tolerates it very well. I've even given it to him straight and he's fine with it. It smells good like milk and is white, not beige or strange in smell. It does foam up a little when mixed but I try to mix a quantity ahead of when I'll need it so the foam has time to settle.<br /><br />No complaints. And I am glad they make it in small cans because I couldn't finish a big can in one month which is when the can says you should finish it after opening. I highly recommend this formula to anyone who has to supplement their breast milk supply or wants to feed their baby a good quality, organic formula.""]"

It makes very delicious curry, if time is available I will add some raw ingredients on the list to enhance the flavour of the curry. Very good buy and recommended to everyone. Lisa, [...]', 'I love curry, in its many different forms and preparations. I love the powdery yellow curry, Red Curry, Green Curry, Massaman Curry...Indian, Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, South African...and in the case of this product...Rendang Curry, which is Indonesian.<br /><br />Rendang is traditionally made with coconut milk, galangal, tumeric, ginger root, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chilis, and other spices. Making this dish usually takes hours, but with this box you can cut down that time a bit.<br /><br />You brown your meat, whether its lamb or beef, pour in the curry mixture (which I added coconut milk to instead of water like other reviewers) then cook for another 15 to 20 minutes and let it get all married together and smelling magnificent. And although this is an Indonesian dish I paired it with Jasmine rice to bring out more flavors and add another aromatic layer. I also recommend serving with some cold sides like chopped tomato, cucumber, carrot, and red onion.', 'This is the authentic product, I can vouch for it since I am from India. The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.<br /><br />The lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).<br /><br />I usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you\'re in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.<br /><br />Once done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.<br /><br />Variations:<br />I sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a ""Lamb Vindaloo"". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.<br /><br />If you\'re a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you\'ll get a fantastic dish.<br /><br />Pairing:<br />Pair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy. Yummy!']"

The demand has driven the cost up to $3.80 for a 2-ounce carton at the few grocery stores that carry them.  Countless sprouters hawk their wares on the Internet selling both seeds and all sorts of fancy sprouting devices at a premium.  Add shipping to that.  Many growers make their own sprouters - and there are as many different designs as there are growers. Many websites show good pictures of these setups.  Most use glass jars with screen wire replacing the lid. After reading every bit of information I could find on growing broccoli sprouts, I ordered my first batch of seeds.  First off, at $20.00 a pound on Amazon.Com, these seeds  are $5.00/lb. cheaper than the competition plus Amazon offers free shipping.<br />I opted for a clear plastic jar in stead of glass for a sprouter. Glass and cats do NOT mix. I had to order three types of stainless steel wire before I got the size that was perfect.  Here\'s what works best for me. Stainless Steel Type 304 Mesh #16 X 16 .018"" Wire Diameter 12"" x 12"" available at Amazon for $8.62 with free shipping. #16 means the number of openings per lineal inch. Most craft stores sell scissors to cut wire mesh.  Fiskars makes a good pair.  Cut a circle 1mm larger in diameter than the mouth of your growing jar.  I use Folgers 12oz. coffee jars(38oz.liquid capacity) and cut out the lid with a Dremmel leaving only the rim with a 1mm ridge to the inside.  Insert the wire mesh circle into the top of the remaining lid. It should slightly bow outward but not so much that you can\'t rest the jar upside down with the lid on.(see attached photo image) Draining after washing is the part that gets tricky.  I read one website that said beat, slam, shake or do whatever necessary to thoroughly drain the sprouts after washing. So, I killed my first two jars of baby sprouts by blunt force tramma. They turned to mush.  Here\'s a secret I learned the hard way.  Wash the seeds/sprouts by swirling them in cold water for about 20 seconds.  Then, instead of violent slamming, simply place the growing jar upside down on a fluffed white paper towel.  After a minute, squeeze out the towel, refluff it and place it back under the lid.  No beating.  No knocking.  No shaking.  After ten minutes, your sprouts are well drained, still fluffed and happy.  The paper towel soaks the excess moisture through the screen better than any other method I\'ve found.  Next, place the jar on its side in indirect sunlight between 66 and 70 degrees. I like a window sill behind a thin curtain.  Wash and drain twice a day.  For me, they grow much better when not compressed.  Two or three times a day, I\'ll rotate the jar about 90 degrees to allow them to gently tumble and bring submerged sprouts to the light. Another thing that seems to help is a very gentle air circulation flowing across the screen.  I have a small air cleaner/filter set on low about six feet away from the containers. From the first step of soaking the seeds to harvest, it takes me between 8 and 12 days. I understand that different varieties of seeds sprout differently and there are many variables to consider.  I wait until my jar becomes full of sprouts. Even the few seeds that don\'t sprout and the hulls are edible.  Some people remove these. During the final draining, most of the husks will float away and stick to the inside of the sprouter making them easy to remove. On average, 3 tablespoons of seeds yields 6.4oz of drained sprouts per jar. Based on the weights I\'m getting on a postage scale, $20.00 in seeds yields about $90.00 in sprouts.  They are greener than the pale sprouts from the grocery store and taste much better, too.  This is a fun and productive hobby for the Winter months.  I have yet to come up with a cool growing idea for the Summer.  I\'m thinking of a very small, shelf-type refrigerator set at 68 degrees and rigging it where the light will stay on inside.  Another bright idea that might burn out.', 'I\'ve used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0"">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I\'d ""upgrade"" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren\'t. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don\'t get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn\'t pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I\'d also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I\'m using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio\'s updated drip sprouter, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04"">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can\'t see the sprouts once they\'ve grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a ""real"" kitchen gardener. But I just didn\'t. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand.']"

It feels very cooling and soothing going down and as long as I keep that cool smooth feeling inside, I have merely mild flashes and those only occasionally. I am so thankful to Essentia!  Drinking the water I had on hand that I thought was optimal had not helped the hot flashes at all even when treated to supposedly be alkaline.  So I do not know exactly what it is about Essentia that is working for me as I have not scientifically experimented with it to see if it is one of the ingredients or what.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia for resolving my hot flashes which were really wearing me out!<br /><br />Although Essentia water is a little more expensive to buy it on Amazon, I decided to purchase here.  My local Whole Foods offers 20% off cases and my local Jimbo\'s offers 10% off cases and I have not asked Henry\'s, Sprouts, or other grocers what their discounts are; so it would actually be a little cheaper for me to buy it locally but then I have to carry it to the car and from the car to my home and it is much nicer for me to pay a little extra and have it delivered by UPS so I do not have to move the bottles by the 30pound case but only by a bottle or two at a time.  Also, Essentia gives healthcare professionals, such as myself, 30% off but require a 10 case minimum purchase and I do not want to store 10 cases at a time as in California as space is at a premium and in high demand.  4 cases is optimal for me and I am willing to pay a little extra to not have to carry it myself.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia and Amazon!  You make my life better!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Sprouts sells this for $1.89 for each 1.5liter with 10% discount for a case - no sales tax.

(4)The taste of Del Monte's canned diced tomatoes is good but not quite as good as the taste of Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes.  Why?  (a)Because Muir Glen adds tomato sauce, which is thicker, while Del Monte adds tomato puree, which is thinner, to their canned diced tomatoes.

I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen.

I have tried to use this product in these various ways for several months and it's just horrible and can't be disguised even in other dishes. I'm going to donate the remaining cans to local meals program. The problem is the taste and texture. It tastes burned right out of the can, and has a sandy/gritty or mealy texture that doesn't help. After much consideration, I would describe the taste as a concentrated, burned hamburger bun that caught some of the aroma or seasonings of a hamburger or veggie burger along the way.<br />I love Worthington and Loma Linda's other products and would quickly recommend them such as the canned veggie sausage links, Tender Bites, Burger, the frozen Morningstar Farms and Boca burgers, sausage and crumbles, etc. Redi-Burger though is so bad that it could make a vegetarian reconsider eating meat."", ""Bisto is hands down the best!

Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i/o something dry and bland.<br />I do the same thing in the bottom of the broiler pan as I cook the meat so when the meat is done, the gravy is already hot, has the drippings and just needs a quick reduction and it's ready to serve.<br /><br />You'll never fail at gravy-making with Bisto Favourite!"", 'Bought the first case on a whim thinking that I would sneak some in the chili or tacos without telling the family.

Eventually he wanted to add some burger to something he was preparing and we did not have it in the house, so he grabbed a can of this.  He has loved it ever since!  This comes unseasoned so be prepared to season it well to go along with whatever it is you are using it in.  Originally I planned on only using it in chili and for taco ""meat"", but we have expanded the use.  Yesterday we made meatloaf that had ground turkey blended with this and it turned out terrific.  The hubby blends it all the time with ground turkey and the kids are totally unaware.  We did try it once with a box of hamburger helper and we won\'t do that again- messed up the texture too much.

While I really enjoy the taste of my regular house/breakfast blend with a splash of vanilla creamer (I don't have to add sugar), it seemed that my normal splash of vanilla creamer did not complement the vanilla already in the coffee.

Upon inspection of the grounds you can see small bits of actual vanilla beans.  The aroma is great and better than traditional flavored coffees that use extracts that coat the beans or are roasted into them.<br /><br />I brewed the coffee using my Capresso 10-cup coffee maker with cold fresh water and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 6 ounce cup of water.<br /><br />The coffee brewed with an aroma of coffee and vanilla. The vanilla dominated the brewing smells. First sip of of dark roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla flavor. I like the mild vanilla flavor. I love coffee and I usually don't like flavors masking the flavor of the beans. Roastmasters work hard to perfect their roasts and often times the flavors added destroy that. This is not the case with this coffee. The vanilla flavor augments the roast and adds to it, not takes away from it. The vanilla flavor is also fresher and more natural without the cloying artificial taste often associated with flavored coffee.<br /><br />My only beef with this coffee and with starbucks in general is that they often over roast their coffees to Italian roasts or beyond the second crack. I find this often masks complexities of the wonderful beans they use and substitute heavy mouthfeel and body for complexity. For that reason, I only give this coffee a four star rating.<br /><br />Another note is that this coffee seems to have plenty of caffeine. With only a cup or two, I feel the effects quite strongly, which is unusual because of the amount of coffee and tea I drink.<br /><br />Overall a good flavored coffee.

I picked up a bottle of this horsecrap at Lowe\'s after trying some of the EcoSMART Mosquito & Tick Control and failing to eradicate my backyard mosquito problem. I figured, how hard could it be to manufacture a garden hose attached spray bottle and adhere to Bernoulli\'s principle. Apparently the answer is ""very.""<br /><br />I followed the directions line by line to be sure I didn\'t screw anything up. I shook the container well. I attached the garden hose to my ready spray nozzle. I made sure the dial was in the off position. Then when I got to step 4 all hell broke loose. I turned the water on carefully (at the faucet, just like the directions said). I hadn\'t even turned the water on all the way, maybe just 25%, and I noticed from across the lawn that the ready spray nozzle was readily spraying water out the back of the nozzle at extreme pressure. I mean EXTREME pressure. Little tiny streams of super pressurized water that could cut through flesh with more efficiency than a .50 caliber. That lasted for approximately 7 seconds until the entire hose, complete with the screw-on portion of the ready spray nozzle, exploded away from the rest of the container and fired the hose back about 3 feet.<br /><br />Like any good homeowner would do at that point, I turned off the water and strolled over to survey the damage. Thankfully, it looked repairable. I unscrewed the blue screw-end off the hose, making sure that the rubber washer came with it and then forcefully jammed it back onto the end of the nozzle. Maybe I had screwed it onto the hose too tightly, maybe I had turned the water on too fast with too much pressure. I figured what the hell, I\'ll try it again. 2nd time, same result. 3rd time, same result.<br /><br />For my next attempt I figured I\'d outsmart the bugger and skip ahead a few steps. So before turning the water on, I bent the safety tab back and turned the dial clockwise until it stopped. I thought to myself, ""Sweet, water will automatically mix with the product when I turn the hose on and I\'ll eliminate my back pressure problem. Rock on."" Naturally my next move was to turn the water on. In hindsight, this was clearly a terrible move. I turned the water on and from the other side of the lawn everything looked to be in order. The sprayer was spraying and the hose was still attached. I jogged over and picked up the bottle and started to walk at a steady pace while spraying using an even sweeping motion, slightly overlapping the areas to be treated. But as soon as I moved the bottle around a little bit, the little tiny streams of super pressurized flesh destroying water returned with a vengeance and began nailing me in the face with anger and rage. I refused to lose and restrained both the hose and the nozzle with both hands using an overhand death grip most likely taught in MMA schools throughout Brazil and other parts of South America.<br /><br />I finally had it under control. The spray was coming out the right end and the hose remained attached to the bottle. Never mind that the muscles in my hands were quickly starting to burn from the sheer force that I had to apply to keep the whole system intact and operating. But whatever, it was working. After a couple minutes of running around my yard like a blind monkey on acid, I decided to look into the clever little window they build into the side of the bottle to make sure that the chemical was actually coming out with the stream of water. Nothing. Hadn\'t gone down even a centimeter. I set the bottle onto the ground carefully making sure not to loosen up the insanity driven choke grip that I had on the bottle and I watched. I watched for 5 minutes. I smelled the spray coming out looking for any sign of the chemicals. Nothing. Not a god damned thing. The only thing coming out of that sprayer was water.<br /><br />I blinked. It must have been a little longer than average because by the time I opened my eyes the whole thing was over. I was soaking wet. Shoes, shirt, shorts, face, everything. The bottle was laying several feet away. The hose was by my side quietly pouring water onto the lawn. A bird chirped in the distance. At least it was over. After a good fight it was time to accept defeat and move on with my life.<br /><br />I may never be the same after this day.

Also inside are individually wrapped containers of Late July brand rich crackers, Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame with salt, Gopicnic's Chili Lime Salmon spread, Gopicnic's Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix, and a Terra Nostra's organic robust dark chocolate square.  These items are all shelf stable for several months as long as kept in a cool dry place (meaning that you probably shouldn't store these in your car in the summertime for more than a few hours).<br /><br />I have a love hate relationship with salmon.  Either I love it (usually in the form of spreads and cakes) or I hate it (grilled, broiled, pan fried filets) so I expected to love this version.  Surprisingly, I'm kind of on the fence about this very orange appearing spread.  It has a nice salmon flavor (and large flakes of fish in the mix) that is just slightly fishy and you can taste the lime, but to me the chili was really lacking.  I think with more of a chili note in the spread I would have enjoyed it much more. 3 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Salmon Spread Ingredients:Alaskan pink salmon, water, red pepper paste, sugar, lime juice, modified cornstarch, salt, vinegar, garlic powder, chili powder, spices (no MSG), natural lime flavor, maltodextrin, and natural color.  The salmon comes from a MSC certified fishery.<br /><br />The Late July Crackers (which I have had before) are always delicious and remind me much of a flaky butter type cracker.  The salmon spread went well on them and they weren't brittle enough to break when the spread was applied.  The utensil given for this purpose was a fork. 6 Crackers come in a pack and I found that I had a little more salmon than cracker (although I didn't go crazy with the application. 5 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Cracker Ingredients: Organic Wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice, organic oleic safflower oil and/or organic oleic sunflower oil, organic palm oil, sea salt, leavening, soy lecithin, enzymes.<br /><br />I didn't really like the Dry Roasted Edamame.  The only taste at all that I got from them was the bare hint of salt added.  I think with all the other flavor packed items in this picnic a seasoned variety could have better competed with everything.  Otherwise it was somewhat bland and I had no desire to finish the small packet. 1 Star for this product<br /><br />Edamame Ingredients:Soybeans, Sea Salt<br /><br />I think my favorite item in this packet would be the Ginger Zip fruit mix.  It was tasty, but not too sweet, with just the lightest touch of ginger that I thought was perfect and didn't overpower the natural flavors of the dried fruit and peanut mixture.  Sadly, it was only a .75 oz packet and I ran out before I wanted to.  I would gladly have traded the edamame for a bigger packet of this snack. 5 Stars for this product<br /><br />Mix Ingredients:Ginger peanuts, (sugar, ground ginger, sea salt), cranberries, banana chips.<br /><br />Last but not least is the dark chocolate square.  I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and since this was 60% cacao it suited me just fine.  It had just a hint of sweetness with that wonderful bitterness you can only get from darker chocolates. 4 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Chocolate Ingredients:Organic dark chocolate, dry cocoa solids.<br /><br />Allergies: On all items the packaging warns for Soy, Milk, Wheat, Peanuts, Fish, and Treenuts.<br /><br />Overall I'd have to say that this was a pretty good snack that I could see myself taking to work or on a car trip with me. I'd prefer that a couple of the ingredients would change but it still filled me up despite my avoidance of some items, but didn't over fill me to the point where I felt sleepy after lunch.<br /><br />Review by M.

And they are not so moisture, like regular raisin.<br /><br />For both box, the balance of tart and sweet are same, but i reduce the review from 5 star to 4 star because the dried cherries do not maintain consistency on moisturize.', 'My first experience with dried tart cherries was when I went to visit a friend from Traverse City, Michigan about ten years ago. As a teenager, she had worked in the cherry plant removing pits from the fruit, not uncommon for natives of the Cherry Capital. She took me down to Meijers to buy a box of dried tart cherries to carry home on the plane as a special treat.<br /><br />Then a few years ago, I began buying cherries at Trader Joe\'s and they became a pantry staple for me. Once I realized my friend could get them on sale at Meijers and ship them to me for a significant savings and slight quality advantage over the ones I had been buying, I asked her to do that several times. It never occurred to me to look for them on Amazon where the cost is about the same as having them shipped from Traverse City and I won\'t have to bother my friend.<br /><br />Normally I do not buy sweetened fruit of any kind but the slight amount of sugar is necessary due to the tartness of the cherries, much as lemonade or cranberry juice must be sweetened, and it is completely unnoticeable. A slight bit of oil is also required to keep them from turning into a solid mass of moist chewy goodness!<br /><br />A few of these are great in smoothies, but not too many, as the flavor is very intense. I also enjoy them in oatmeal and cold cereals, with milk chocolate, and out-of-hand as a snack. Once, after carelessly mistaking them for raisins and adding them to scones, I got a very pleasant surprise! They are great in rice pudding, cr&egrave;me brûl&eacute;e, ice cream, and chicken salad.<br /><br />A wonderful one-dish lunch or light summer supper is ""Barley, Bacon and Avocado Salad with Roasted Chicken"", but with these dried tart cherries added. The recipe is easy to find on the internet.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to go to Traverse City to see the cherry blossoms or the fall leaves up on the peninsula, please take advantage of the opportunity as you will surely enjoy it. Now if I could just get Honeybell tangelos from Amazon, I\'d be set!', 'I was very pleased with these dried cherries.  They are delicious -- not too sweet, not too tart.  Healthy, too.']"

It still smells much less than other brands, and I LOVE that I can just flush it and not worry about disposing of a bag of cat poop along with the already gross litter box!  I use the multi-cat one, and I like it!  Worth the extra cost.', 'I\'ve been using this litter with my rescue kitty. (She showed up at my door one day pregnant, and I, like a sap, gave her some food. The very next day she came into the house and started yowling to be fed again!)<br /><br />You basically have to stick your nose IN the litter box to smell anything, which is a huge plus in my book. Less smell!<br /><br />Now, I do want to address some of the complaints you see in the reviews here.<br /><br />First, people saying ""We switched to this, and my cat wouldn\'t use it, and it was a disaster"".<br /><br />Well, cats can be very picky about changes. If your cat is used to a particular type of litter, he or she is not going to want to switch on your say-so. And that doesn\'t matter what brand they\'re used to or what you\'re switching to! A cat raised and litter trained on pine litter would react as badly to being made to use clay litter all of a sudden! Whenever you switch things around with your cat, you have to do it carefully. Put a tiny amount of the new litter on the bottom of the box, and the old litter on top. Then you gradually change the proportions until you\'re using a tiny amount of the old litter and it\'s almost all the new litter. (Some people stay at this stage forever. If you have a very old, set-in-his-ways cat that may be best.)<br /><br />So when people say ""Oh, my cat didn\'t know what to do!"", I don\'t take that very seriously unless they tried to gradually transition their cat.<br /><br />Another thing people have mentioned is that they find the poop doesn\'t get covered. This, to me, is a matter of hygiene. You should really be removing the poop every day, no matter what type of litter you use. If you don\'t wish to do that, though, you should use a different type of kitty litter. This one isn\'t going to work for you.<br /><br />The third thing is that some people have trouble cleaning it. The instructions on the bag say to shake the box so the old, used litter goes to the bottom and the top is fresh pellets. Then you dump it all out when the pellets have mostly been used up. You can do that. I\'ve been changing mine more frequently because our darling IS a little picky (only cat I know who prefers to go out to do her business and then comes back in just like a dog) and what I do is scoop it up and then shake it into the garbage bag. The used stuff stays in the scoop long enough to move over the trash bag, and then when I shake it it drops down. I haven\'t had trouble cleaning the box.<br /><br />Now, with that said, it\'s not for everyone. For one thing, there are plenty of cats who, raised on clay litter, will find this one uncomfortable and awkward to use. But if your cat is very young or more flexible you should definitely look into this.']"

We are constantly trying new teas as we locate them, but it seems that over the years we keep coming back to this brand.  Now as has been noted by another reviewer here, this stuff is NOT packaged in England; it is packaged and distributed here in America.  This does not magically change the flavor of the tea though.  Tea is tea is tea.  Tea is NOT grown in England, so to say that tea that is packaged in England is better than that packaged in America is simply codwollop!  Yes, you might get ""stale"" tea here, but I doubt it. If you keep your tea under proper storage conditions, i.e. out of the light, no moisture and away from heat, it will last quite some time...I can assure you that the producers do this simply because they want to sell you the best tasting product possible. We in this country may not be as adept to brewing tea as our English brothers, but I doubt it.  No, the difference in the taste is more than likely all in the drinkers head.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have and the biggest problem I have noted in our country when it comes to drinking tea made using tea bags is that we seem to be a very, very impatient people.  We simply do not, generally speaking of course, do not let it steep long enough.  A tea such as the one being reviewed here needs to steep no less that three minutes; preferably at least four.  I find myself getting in a bit of a hurry at times and end up drinking very weak and rather tasteless tea simply because I did not wait long enough.<br /><br />Note:  Cost wise, this is on the rather high end for tea bag tea...in my opinion it is quite worth it though.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of my babbling...this is a good tea.  Is it the only tea I drink or ever will drink?  Of course not.  3/4s of the fun of being a tea drinker is continuing throughout life trying different blends and brands.

There is only one other canned tuna available today that is both caught and canned in the US and while it's a good product, the taste and texture of the Henry & Lisa's tuna stands alone. Henry & Lisa's tuna is moist and meaty but at the same time flakes nicely. You will be amazed that this tuna is packed without salt or oil. The saltiness from the fish itself adds to the tastiness of the fish without being too salty as much canned tuna is. It's also amazing how much oil there is in the fish itself. It gives this canned tuna a luxurious, silky texture much like really good Pacific King Salmon. I can never go back to oil packed tuna after having this tuna. You may not even want to dress this tuna, just eat it straight from the can. Henry & Lisa's tuna is spendy (not more than really good Italian tunas though I would argue it's even better than those) but I'm willing to pay more for tuna that is this delicious, that is sustainably caught and very importantly, canned in the USA.<br /><br />FWIW, the other tuna caught and canned in the U.S. is American Tuna. American Tuna is the tuna I will use to cook with (pasta and baked tuna) given that it is more modestly priced and also available in a more economical 4 lb. can.

One thing I wanted was to make homemade babyfood.  I spent weeks watching videos online and reading all I could.  I made a list of everything I would need and marked videos to remember how to make each food.  Then I found the Baby Brezza!  I heard about the Babycook and thought about buying that one.  However, the Baby Brezza has one button that not only steams the food, but then purees it automatically after it steams (Babycook does not)!  As I write this review the steamer just stopped and started to puree..I am in the living room playing with  my baby as the babyfood makes itself in the kitchen!  All I had to do was buy the veggies and fruits (I bought organic) and then peeled, followed the steamer time in the recipe book it came with and that's it!  This is a busy working moms dream!  I just poured the puree into ice cube trays to freeze and I can't wait to feed them to my little one.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product if you are at a loss of where to start and want something super easy.  I bought organic carrots in a jar last week for 79 cents for 2.5 ounces.  I did the math tonight and I was able to make organice sweet potatos for 14 cents for 2.5 ounces!  Carrots would have probably been even cheaper!  I know using kitchen gadgets I already owned would make it even cheaper, but since I bought it for convience and not for the cost, saving money is a bonus and it will pretty much pay for itself!  And it was $50 cheaper than the Baby Cook.  So happy!  And my little one loves the baby food I have made so far!"", ""I won the Beaba from a blog giveaway, but I don't think I would ever spend the money to buy one.  I only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend.<br /><br />It did everything it was advertised to do.  I don't think it saves on time and effort, though.  You still have to clean, peel, and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks, so no time saved there.  If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity.  You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food.  However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes.  Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy.  The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time.  I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once.  With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby.  Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time.<br /><br />Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK.  Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time.  Just one hour  in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer.  I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B for around sixty bucks.  I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time.<br /><br />Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba.  The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers.  Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers.  I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks.  I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer.  Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day.  Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave.<br /><br />After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set."", ""I've just started making baby food for our baby--the Baby Brezza works like a charm!  It makes the whole process very easy.  You can literally chop up a vegetable, put it in the Baby Brezza, and hit the button.  It will steam and puree the food for you!  The instruction manual tells you how long to steam each vegetable.  It purees the food much better than my food processor.  If I used the food processor, I'd have to add an extra step of straining the food after it was pureed.  The only negative to the Baby Brezza is that it only makes limited quantities at a time.  But since the process is so easy, that doesn't bother me.  It's quick and easy to make multiple batches.  Not much to clean up when you're done either.  I pour the puree into ice cube trays to freeze.  In a couple of days, I quickly dip the bottom of the trays in warm water and then pop the cubes out into a zip lock bag to store in our deep freezer.

There are 12 individually sealed packages in the box, and each package has about 20 super-thin seaweed snacks.  They're almost thin enough to read through, and the whole container only has 2 carbs, making them perfect for low-carb dieters.  They're surprisingly filling, and not overly salty.  They are extremely crispy and the entire package should be eaten soon after opening.  Humidity will make them gummy in just a short time.<br /><br />The nutrition information from Annie Chun's website says that each package of this sesame flavor has: 60 calories, 2 grams protein, 140 mg sodium, 5 grams of fat, 70% of daily vitamin A, 12% of daily vitamin C, and minerals (unnamed on the ingredients list).<br /><br />I like that these are all-natural and don't contain preservatives or food coloring.  I like that it's a novel way to eat vegetables, and that my kids love them. Next we'll try the wasabi flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that they use canola oil in them.  Canola oil is in so many foods we eat, and the process used to make it (hexane - a petroleum product, and high heat) causes it to produce free radicals in our body.  Free radicals are linked to obesity, heart disease and degenerative diseases in our bodies.  I would much prefer that all foods be made with cold-pressed oils like olive, peanut or sunflower oil.<br /><br />But canola oil aside, these seaweed snacks are delicious, filling, low carb, and we'll be buying them again."", ""I am hooked on toasted sesame seeds.  I toast them in my countertop oven and keep them in a small parmesan cheese shaker and use them on just about everything.  I was paying over two dollars an ounce by buying the McCormicks one ounce bottles so you can see buying in bulk this way is a very good thing.  Before I bought I was confused about whether I should get hulled or unhulled.  After researching I decided I wanted unhulled and so I choose this brand because everything I get from Bob's Red Mill is great.  When they arrived I was relieved to see they were just want I wanted, exactly the same as the McCormicks.  I allow myself two ounces of toasted sesame seeds per week.  A little goes a long way because the flavor is so intense.  I wanted to make some hummus and although I know it can be tasty without tahini I decided (since I have so much now) to toast and puree some sesame seeds and used about two tablespoons of the resulting thick peanut butter-like paste in the hummus along with some olive oil.  Best hummus I've ever made.  Update - I see the product description now includes a statement saying that the outer coating of these seeds has been removed.  So I guess these are hulled seeds then?  I don't know for sure but they are just like what is in the one ounce canisters of McCormicks."", 'I have to admit, before I opened up the Seaweed Snacks, I was expecting a thicker snack because of the picture on the box.

Our answer: Definitely NOT wasted money! To our suprise, yesterday, my husband and I shared one .35 oz. pkg, which, with a drink, and found that not only was our serving of the ""wafers"" filling enough to take our hunger away until dinner, but was also very tasty!...(Actually, it was so tasty that today, I ate a whole pkg myself!... They\'re sooo addicting!!!). The seaweed flavor is strong enough for its taste to come through, but yet, subtle enough to not overwhelm the tastebuds...Yummy!!<br /><br /> My husband and I liked the snack so much, I told two of our neighbors about them and let them try some. They also liked them alot, so I gave them each a pkg. to take with them. We even broke the snack into little pieces and let my neighbors\' 6 mos. baby suck on them until soft, (when put in the mouth, the hard *wafer* texture  almost immediately  dissolves into the texture of cooked spinach). Once softened she ate about 3 wafers right down!  (If you do let your young child try it..I would strongly recommend an adult breaking, holding, and feeding the small wafer pieces on his/her fingers for the child.) My neighbor said to her husband, *She, (the baby), loves them, too...We have to buy some!*<br /><br />I\'m  glad I\'ve found this snack, as being Seaweed, it has soo many more nutritional benefits,(necessary vitamins and minerals, and being low in fat), that I believe it is a great alternative to many of the other snacks that are being sold. It does, however, have a little more salt on it than I would like...(health wise).  It would be nice if they came out with a low,(or at least a lower salt), seaweed snack package...but even if they dont..I will continue to buy these due to their delicious flavor!<br /><br />Anyway, to summarize it all we decided that  [[ASIN:B003NUYBV8 Annie Chun\'s Seaweed Snacks, Roasted Sesame, 0.35-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)] will be the Perfect Snack for us and would definitely recommend them!<br /><br />  Sarah']"

I tried it and it has become a staple in my daily diet: one large cup a day. Recently, my wife decided to try a cup every now and then, and so far she hasn't had any problems at all due to acid.<br /><br />The coffee tastes full-bodied even though Puroast does something proprietary to reduce the acid in the coffee. The French Roast has plenty of rich coffee taste. I happen to prefer more of a medium roast, but that's just me. All the Puroast coffee varieties that I've tried are plenty good enough for me--with the distinct benefit of low acid. You can get beans or two different grinds, and they sell the coffee in small packets as well as 1-lb, 2-lb and even up to 5-lb bags.

I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?  It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs.

In other words, if something calls for two cups of sugar....use one cup sugar twin and one cup sugar.  I have found that if I use all sugar twin, I am not as happy with the texture.

He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him.

One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon.

When someone convinced me to try these, I couldn't believe I actually liked them!<br /><br />These sardines are really much closer to tuna than traditional sardines. This makes them taste better -- much less fishy. Plus they are packed with Omega-3, which is a bonus in the health department! Really my only complaint is sometimes they come broken up in the can, which makes them messy to eat."", ""These sardines are delicious - pushing the can-opener into the lid produces an invitingly sweet tomato aroma and upon removal of the lid you're confronted with six large well-packed headless boneless shiny-skinned sardines covered in a sea of red.  I use water and rinse away all of the tomato-sauce in an effort to reduce the excessive sodium per serving but luckily enough of the sweet tomato essence is left behind to taste.  Another review commented on the firmness of these sardines - they seem perfectly firm to me - they are not mushy and I'm not sure I would want to eat a harder sardine.  Best of all using Amazon prime these sardines ship to my door for .11 cents/oz; my local average grocery stores (Safeway and Giant in Washington, DC) sell the name-brand average quality 4 oz sardine cans at .42+ cents/oz.<br /><br />My favorite preparation: Open can, rinse sardines well with water, darkly toast thick slices of rye or multigrain bread, place sardines on top of toast, cover sardines with any remaining tomato sauce from the can, sprinkle some fresh lemon juice and cayenne pepper over it all and you've got a meal!"", ""I've been getting these sardines for 4 months under the subscription program and am quite satisfied. There are usually 3 sardines per can, sometimes 4. Occassionally there may be a tiny spec of skin still present, but not usually.  I would characterize the taste as mild which is just fine with me. I think some people who call these bland are more used to sardines packed in olive oil and a lot of salt, but these are a lower salt alternative and have less calories than those packed in olive oil. The quality has been very consistent, and i consume a half can of these sardines every day on wheat bread with humus.<br />I have had briesling sardines, which, as i understand it, are very young and tender sardines, and they were superior to these sardines, but i have always found briesling sardines to be a lot more expensive. These sardines suit my needs and price range very well and i enjoy them a lot.<br />As you probably know, sardines are a very good source of omega-3 fatty acids (the good kind), like other fish. But unlike larger fish, sardines tend to have lower mercury content, which makes them an ideal protein rich snack.""]"

It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that\'s how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn\'t sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn\'t want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don\'t think it\'s quite there yet.  It\'s also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets\' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn\'t sure how to use it at first, but it didn\'t take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won\'t be buying this again.', ""The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'."", ""The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.""]"

I gave this five stars because I like drinking Crystal Lite mixes in just about all their flavors."", 'These new ""mocktails"" from Crystal Light are pretty awesome for sugar-free folk who are tired of the old standbys of raspberry ice, fruit punch, iced tea with peach, and so on.  Instead of going for another standard fruit flavor they mimic a variety of mostly fluffy drinks, and they all manage to taste remarkably like the hard drink they are modeled after.<br /><br />The mojito version has a nice trace of mint, although its flavor is much more mild and light than the appletini edition, which is probably the best of the bunch. Using more or less water when mixing can easily change the flavor if you want it a little stronger. Much like with the appletini, the mojito Crystal Light works great as a mixer for alcohol if you want to spice it up and make it more like the real thing.<br /><br />This is definitely recommended if you regularly enjoy Crystal Light and want to try something different from the standard array of flavors.']"

We have gophers and bought this trap online.  The only problem is that the part that should come down and trap/kill the gopher gets stuck with the dirt when you set the trap up.  I'm not sure if we didn't dig down far enough or what the problem was, but the gopher issue was not solved with this product."", 'Pro: Effective when used properly: trapped the pest within a day of properly setting it.  Inexpensive: compared to the damage done by the pest<br /><br />Con: Not for everyone: Required some hand strength/dexterity to set the trigger and to remove the victim.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I live in a perfect location for moles and gophers to thrive, rural enough to have open fields nearby yet suburban enough to keep their natural predators (e.g. snakes, coyotes and bobcats) from effectively intervening.<br /><br />Moles invaded my pristine lawn a few years back and were caught using scissor traps.  However, a year ago, my mole trapping prowess waned as my entire landscape, not just the lawns, was ravaged.  Believing that a new generation of ""smarter"" moles had evolved, I stepped up my trapping regimen while I evaluated ""smarter"" traps.  My past moles inadvertently damaged plants but never destroyed them.  As my ornamental scrubs continued to fall prey one by one, I theorized that the culprit was perhaps a gopher, which unlike a mole eats roots, gnaws on the base of plants and chews up grass around its mounds.  A couple weeks back, as I stood on my front porch, a gopher popped out from a freshly excavated hole and stared me down with its beady eyes -- it felt like a scene from Caddyshack!<br /><br />I placed my order for these traps within the hour. Although most traps seemed lethal, these traps seemed the least invasive yet preserved proof of ""habeus corpus.""  I chose the Sweeneys because they could be set at the mouth of a fresh opening that the gopher would eventually backfill.  This would eschew both the guesswork of finding the ideal location as well as the unearthing the trap when checking or resetting.  I suppose the equivalent Victor traps would have sufficed.<br /><br />As soon as they arrived, I anxiously unpacked and familiarized myself with them.  When setting the Sweeneys, I found the opening diameter made by my gopher prevented the trap from being placed entirely into the hole.  Moreover, it kept the sprung trap from clearing the top of the tunnel.  This was remedied with a bit of trowel work, though.  The trap itself required some hand strength and simultaneous dexterity to set and arm.  I practiced a couple of times arming and triggering it.  The entire trap was placed inside the hole but the metallic trigger plate was purposely left visible.  The trap was tethered to a stake at the mouth of the opening in case the trapped gopher was still able to retreat back into its burrow.  This also made it easier to extract the trapped critter without digging up the entire trap.<br /><br />The next day, the trap was sprung and the gopher was done.  Removing it from the trap required a bit more manual coordination given the carcus prevented clear access to the pincers.  I inserted the shaft of a screwdriver under the gopher across the arms of the trap and stepped down on both ends leaving my hands free to extricate the deformed, lifeless body.  Even though I have had no more visible signs of gopher activity since then, I have reset the trap and placed it in a less conspicious location for peace of mind.<br /><br />I hope this helps.', 'I usually do not write reviews on Amazon (or anywhere else for that matter), but I really have to make an exception in this case because of how well this device works.  It is rare for any device to work exactly as expected, but the Victor Blackbox Gopher Trap works above and beyond any expectations that I had for it.  I do not work for the Victor company, and I have no financial stake in the sales of their products.  I am simply an exasperated homeowner who got fed up wih gophers tearing up his property and decided to give this device a try.<br /><br />I had used poison pellets, smoke bombs, water hose, and those silly sonic devices... nothing worked and those gophers were probably laughing at me.  With the Blackbox, it\'s nearly a sure thing.  Also, you actually get to see the results with a dead gopher right in front of you, unlike smoke bombs and poison which are always a guessing game as to whether or not they actually did their job.<br /><br />Within 2 day of getting this product, I had already caught 3 gophers.  One of those gophers was caught less than 1 hour after I set the trap.  Free lunch on my property is now officially over.<br /><br />The key to the effectiveness of this trap is to find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br /><br />My sure kill method:<br /><br />1) Find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br />2) Dig out the mound until you find the tunnel.<br />3) Place the activated trap flush with the entrance of the tunnel, with the small round hole (on one side of the trap) facing outward.<br />4) Cover up the gaps at the top, sides and bottom of the trap with dirt so that it looks like the tunnel extends into the Blackbox, but make sure the opening to the trap is unobstructed from inside their tunnel.<br /><br />The idea is to make the trap seem like an extension of the gopher\'s tunnel, and by instinct the gopher will head towards that small open hole on the other side of the trap to plug it up (they don\'t like any openings into their tunnels).  Once he enters the trap, it\'s goodnight Gracie.  This trap is so strong that the gopher will be nearly snapped in half.<br /><br />Before getting the Blackbox, I had also tried using a ""Macabee"" gopher trap (the one with the 2 pincers that snap together) but the gopher simply pushed that trap out of his tunnel.  The Macabee is also a lot more risky to use and harder to set (in terms of triggering it accidentally on your hand).  The Blackbox is safer to use and much easier to set because the trigger mechanism and the killing device is contained fully within the box itself.  The Macabee trap can also be dragged away by a dying gopher if it is not properly secured.  There is definitely no chance of a gopher dragging away a Blackbox.<br /><br />In summary, I wish I had used the Blackbox from the beginning.  It would have saved me a lot of time, money, frustration and parts of my yard.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug-17-2011:  I have just posted some pics as proof of the effectiveness of this device.  After 13 captures within the first 4 months of use, I have not seen any more gopher activity since April 2011. I guess word got out in the gopher community that there is now a steep price of admission onto this property.']"

I suggested that they write that.<br /><br />-I can\'t imagine anyone would want the regular salted peanuts!  Planters should have ""lightly salted"" be the default.  People would probably eat Less of the regular planters peanuts and it\'s less healthy.  Even for this lightly salted version, there\'s a disclaimer that reads ""Contains 95mg sodium per serving compared to 190 in planters dry roasted peantus, not a low sodium food.""  Well, why not have 3 grades, no salt, almost no salt, and finally lightly salted and get rid of the regularly salted.<br /><br />The label does say ""Kraft Foods Global, INC.  Northfield, IL, USA.""  I really want to know if these peanuts were grown and roasted in the USA.  It helps to write which part is in the USA at the minimum.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Taste like peanuts, no complaints, just wish it\'s even less salty.  Maybe I should go with the no salt version in the future.']"

But Zico changed their packaging AND processing (instead of fresh, it\'s now from concentrate). If it had still tasted the same, I prolly wouldn\'t care it was from concentrate, really. But when does a ""from concentrate"" drink EVER taste as good as natural. Have natural tangerine juice, then drink one from concentrate? Yeah, not the same.<br /><br />So, I\'ve tried O.N.E. and VitaCoco and assorted brands found in supermarkets and Latino stores over the years. But I always went back to Zico. Now that Zico is horrible (tastes and smells funny), I needed a new coconut water for my daily fix. I decided to try this since amazon offered it to me in a Gold Box Deal. Well, it arrived today and I LOVE IT.<br /><br />It has a nice sweetness and a clean taste and it\'s got that refreshing quality that chilled coconut water gives. Heck, I even like it at room temperature. It\'s not the stinky-sour horror Zico now is.<br /><br />I also like that it\'s organic. That\'s a bonus!<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that the can is great for chilling it up real cold.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently, this brand pasteurizes at quite high temps, so there is a legitimate concern that it loses nutrient content. I therefore recommend that, for those who want more than just a great taste, you either email the company and confirm if they have switched to flash pasteurization, or switch to Amy and Brian\'s (which flash pateurizes and has a BPA free container).<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer that says those other brands are tastier. I grew up drinking coconut water (my dad would split them open with a machete for us to sip straight out of the coconut), and this one tops O.N.E., which has been my Zico substitute until now,  and VitaCoco (which I do agree is sourish and way down the choice list). But what ""tastes good"" is subjective and we won\'t agree on best taste. But I can tell you this tastes really close to real coconut water fresh from a tree in your backyard (though nothing beats the real, fresh thing). I\'m assuming changes in flavor are to be expected since coconut water will vary from nut to nut. Even Zico was not consistent formerly, sometimes sweeter, sometimes more water, depending, I assume, on the batch of coconuts. Any drink that\'s from actual fresh juice will have variations (and I guess Zico went to concentrate in part to standardize the flavor). So, I may just have a crazy good batch here in my hands. :)<br /><br />I\'ve just signed on for a subscription and three cases are on their way to me, yay! Thanks, Amazon, for this alternative now that I\'m exiled from Zico. Heh.<br /><br />Update: I tried Amy and Brian\'s CW after this one, and I actually prefer the A&B due to the sweetness. It has that lovely light, clean, fresh taste that Nature Factor has, just sweeter. That may not be the best for everyone (some folks will want it less sweet, not more, due to the difference in carbs). But for me, I love sweetness, so I\'m hooked. But you can\'t go wrong with either NF or A&B. Enjoy either or both--as I will. So great to discover fabulous new beverages that are healthful.<br /><br />Addendum re Potassium: This possible potassium-compromising may end up being great for those who want, not just organic, but to minimize potassium intake but enjoy coconut water (ie, those on Ace Inhibitors or potassium sparing drugs, those with kidney function issues). I\'d check with the company first--definitely-- to make sure of actual postassium content before considering it safe for the K-avoiding crowd. Something to consider, though, what with so many Americans on high blood pressure meds. But until the company confirms or denies or makes clear what it\'s ACTUAL end-product electrolytes/Potassium content is, K-avoiders should avoid all coconut water unless your docs okay it.', 'I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn\'t made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I\'m glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I\'ve ever had. It\'s not the worst, but it\'s down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won\'t be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10"">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.

I use agave nectar a lot, but I use this sweetener like sugar when agave just wont substitute well in a recipe. It works great. I havent had any problems with it.', 'from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don\'t kill the messenger.<br /><br />It\'s easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It\'s also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there\'s zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it\'s low-glycemic (we\'ll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What\'s not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it\'s largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it\'s commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it\'s the fructose part of sweeteners that\'s the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it\'s considered a fiber. But there\'s not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn\'t mean it\'s good for you.']"

They have a grainy texture that I love, but are still extremely moist and chewy. The mix requires you to add butter, two eggs and a couple of tablespoons of oil and water, but you do not need an electric mixer and it is simple to stir everything together with a wooden spoon. The directions say to melt the butter before adding it to the mix, and since you must also grease the pan, I follow this little trick to make life easier: I melt the butter in the microwave inside the glass pan that I am going to bake the brownies in. After it is melted, I tip the pan from side to side to coat the bottom and sides, then I pour the melted butter into the bowl that I am using to mix everything together. After mixing I pour the batter back into the buttered glass pan. This way I don\'t need to use cooking spray to coat the pan, nor do I need to dirty a separate small bowl to melt the butter, plus the brownies taste better when the pan is buttered instead of coated with Pam. A win-win!<br /><br />Another thing I have done is bake half the mix to make a smaller batch of brownies and save the rest for another time. This is easy to do because the amount of eggs and butter called for is easy to divide in half (two eggs means you can half it and use one egg; 1/2 cup butter goes to 1/4 cup, 2 tbsp oil goes to 1 tbsp).<br /><br />Note that the brownie mix has chunks of chocolate in it--and very good chocolate at that.  That must be why they call it ""double chocolate.""  I wasn\'t sure if I would like this but it is fabulous.  The quality of the chocolate alone justifies the fact that this mix cost more than other mixes.  Trust me--you won\'t be disappointed.<br /><br />PS - their pancake/waffle mix is great, too, and for that you only add water. It is so easy and so much better than Bisquick, Krusteaz, etc.<br /><br />PPS - I just read the other reviews and I see that many people are commenting on the health aspects such as whole wheat and no fillers.  I did not buy these for that reason but what a terrific bonus.  They are so good I would buy them as a special treat even if they were bad for me.  :)', ""Prepare for a chocolate overload with these brownies!  Scrumptious brownies with chocolate chips inside ensure you get an overdose of chocolate with every bite.  VERY simple to make.  You just beat an egg, add 1/3 oil and 1/3 water then the brownie mix.  Beat with a spatula about 40 times, then pour into a baking dish sprayed with oil.  Cooks in about 45 mintues.  Doesn't cool fast enough especially because the house fills up with yummy brownie smells and you just about go insane waiting to pop them in your mouth!<br /><br />Hint: Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil prior to spraying with oil.  That way, once the brownies are cooled, you just lift out the foil and peel away from the brownies easily without anything sticking to the bottom of the dish, and you can just transfer onto a plate once they're cooled and cut."", ""I AM NEW TO MEDIFAST (one week)! MY VERY FIRST ITEM TO ORDER---BROWNIES! My first 2 pk were experimental, BUT PACKETS 3 THRU 7 WERE PERFECT & DELICIOUS. The first  I followed the directions: added 3TB water & microwaved 1m 15sec & another 15sec & another etc. up to 2 mins & it was still under cooked, watery like rice pudding &lt;ate it anyways, but was disappointed, it didn't look like youtube's fitandfabBy40. I had  viewed her video making it &  it looked just like a brownie>. My second attempt, I baked as I had read here on review, but it didn't rise at all instead deflated to thin layer (which I put in freezer & took it out couple hours later & ate it between my fingers like a piece of chocolate square---tasted just like a Frozen Fudgesicle...WOW) hope for it yet i thought. Then the 3rd packet I decided to only add 2 Tablespoons of water, stir & then it was too thick, so i added 1/2 tbsp more & mixed again until it's like a thick fudge consistency. Microwaved for 1 min & 15 secs. And VOILA!! Finally that worked, I watched the brownie rise almost to the top of the cardboard & was very happy...IT BAKED JUST LIKE A BROWNIE! I LOVE IT!!The rest of my brownies came out just as perfect.... I ended up having brownies 2 more times. whoa went through that box.

I traveled to Japan in 2009 and unknowingly had Matcha several times at random sushi restaurants, etc. It was interesting there but I just figured it was a normal green tea, nothing special right? Oh man, was I wrong! This stuff really is something to pay attention to, and the different flavor and health benefits possible with matcha are well beyond any standard green tea. This is really a fascinating beverage and I am excited to get back into it.<br /><br />Before this, I had never tried a flavoured matcha, in fact I had no idea such a thing could exist! Red Leaf pulls off the flavoured matcha with grace and skill, and offers a wild and impressive set of expected (vanilla bean, caramel, etc.) flavours and some wildly crazy and epic sounding ones (Coca Cola Matcha?!!!!) I am gonna have to try that one.<br /><br />I bought the Red Leaf Starter (Basic Grade), Delicate flavouring of Caramel Matcha. This is available on their site here: [...]<br /><br />Since I am a bit of a matcha newbie, I had to read their site about how to prepare it. It was very helpful. I got a whisk from Japantown and used a Chashaku (Bamboo Scoop) to measure out the matcha. I used 2 scoops and my first cup used the suggested amount, 3 oz of 80C water. I whisked it, poured it from the bowl to a mug and drank it from a mug, no extra water added. This was my previous experience with matcha in general, quite thick and vegetal. It was good.<br />In fact it was so good, I found myself going back to the kitchen to make a 2nd cup of it not 1 hr later!! This time I decided to change it up a bit, using only 1 scoop of matcha this time and a little less water, and then after whisking, adding a fair bit more water to reduce the thickness and make a larger drink. I think I actually enjoyed this better, it was a little sweeter this way and also allowed for a more tea-like experience (rather than a sort of ""tea shot"" like I had earlier). This was very tasty!<br /><br />These are the only ways I have prepared it so far but I think it might be wiser (for my unrefined palate!) to buy the ""Distinctive"" flavouring next time so that I can get a stronger flavor. This one is subtle, but I tend to enjoy stronger more bold flavourings in my tea, so I think the next one I get from Red Leaf I will pay just a little extra to get more flavouring. Excited to follow this new tasty and healthy habit!', ""Red Tea Leaf's Espresso Matcha is amazing!<br /><br />This product has helped with the joint inflammation in my hands.  I was told I had arthritis and that it would probably get worse.  After my own research, I found that an anti-inflammatory diet could help.  Matcha Green Tea was mentioned by several sources. Red Tea Leaf teas are excellent and their customer service is fast and friendly.  I had tried several different brands, but Red Tea Leaf's variety of favors that they mix with the Matcha was what drew me to this company.<br /><br />I chose Espresso Matcha because I am a coffee drinker, but wanted to drink several glasses of Matcha Green Tea a day and knew I would have to forgo my coffee to drink this much (and I love coffee).  There is a subtle flavor of espresso mixed with the Matcha green tea.<br /><br />During a workout when a bar bell completely slipped out of my hand because I lost my grip, I decided I had to try something.  I stopped drinking coffee `cold turkey' as soon as my Espresso Matcha from Red Tea Leaf order arrived and never once got a headache.<br /><br />My favorite summer time way to drink this tea is to mix 1 heaping scoop of Matcha green tea into my 20 oz. water bottle the night before, then refrigerate so I `m ready to go in the morning (I make 3 of these each night when I `m packing my lunch).  Just make sure to shake it before you drink it, the Matcha tea settles to the bottom.  Within two weeks, the ache-y feeling in my hands every morning almost completely disappeared!  I am able to grip jars to open them without pain.  During my workouts, I focus completely on form and only later realize, I never thought once about my hands!  They do not hurt... at all!<br /><br />As for my diet, I ate very `clean' before I started drinking Matcha tea from Red Tea Leaf and I love scientific research (I know, nerdy), so drinking 3 heaping scoops of Matcha tea a day was the only change that I made.  I consistently drink 60-80 oz of water now, but even before when I tried drinking this much water to flush out my system my hands still hurt.  It was not until I added the Match green tea from Red Tea leaf that I noticed an improvement in my hand.<br /><br />I am so happy with this product!  Thank you Red Tea Leaf!"", 'I should mention that my first experience with matcha was not a positive one. We had bought a pouch of matcha from a tea store that shall not be named, and my fiance spent some time looking around on the internet figuring out exactly how much matcha to use for a cup of tea. Needless to say, it didn\'t go terribly well. I took one sip, looked at her, and said ""Are you serious, you actually want to drink this?"". Except it also involved swearing.<br /><br />I put my interest in matcha on a back burner at that point. Maybe it was something a future, more refined me would enjoy, but definitely not today.<br /><br />Then, Red Leaf Tea started showing up and making a huge effort to bring in new customers from Steepster. Reviews started popping up about their fantastic matcha, and the awesome flavors that they have. When the Belgium Chocolate Matcha went on sale, I knew it was time to give matcha another try. I figured, if I can\'t enjoy half-priced, chocolate flavored matcha from what appears to be the best matcha vendor around, there was probably no hope.<br /><br />For preparing this, my fiance used her battery-powered frother, as opposed to the traditional matcha tools. It may be bucking convention, but it really seems to create a nice, smooth evenly distributed cup of matcha. This resulted in a smooth, but murky jade green drink, which is significantly darker than the matcha-that-shall-not-be-named. This makes it obvious that there is true cocoa powder in here, as opposed to just a flavoring (unless there was a flavoring and a coloring, then all bets are off).<br /><br />It definitely smells very chocolatey, very sweet without any sugar added. It reminds me of a chocolate cake batter, or possibly muffin batter. There\'s the chocolately sweetness to it, but the hint of background... well, I suppose it\'s the smell of the matcha itself. Anyway, the matcha smell in the background elevates it a little bit to a baked-good smell, at least for me.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth. At first, it has a warm hot cocoa flavor to it, absolutely delicious. It is inviting, and comforting, with a subtle sweetness on your tongue (much more subtle in taste than in smell). To me, the first drink was overwhelmingly cocoa flavored, with no vegetal taste to betray the matcha lurking below. Each successive drink makes that matcha flavor come out a little bit more. There is a strangely beneficial aspect to this, and that is that the matcha flavor itself slowly builds on you. It\'s very crisp and clean, lightly foresty but without that swampy, seaweed taste that some green tea comes with.<br /><br />As you get to the end of the drink, there is some matcha that has settled towards the bottom. This is likely because I\'m a little bit of a slow drinker, sensitive to hot liquids and such. Or, we really have no clue what we\'re doing. Always a possibility.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this matcha, especially if you\'re new to the world of matcha. It has renewed my faith in matcha as a viable beverage choice.<br /><br />You can also get this from Red Leaf Tea\'s website, with a staggering number of different options.']"

After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I\'d been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I\'ve got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I\'m concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan.', 'The bag product is good, i enjoy lipton products.

The real merit of this ""review"" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for ""Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.""  The Amazon product image clearly said ""Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream"" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, ""Chocolate Cream Oreo"".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: ""Chocolate Cream Oreo"".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say ""Double Stuf"" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.', ""I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.

Hemp increases my level of energy without an other artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers, like sugar and saturated fat, and common energy bars. Contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch and sugar. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing all different type of sports or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success.

I have tried several gluten-free sandwich breads, and Udi's is the best I've tried. It looks, smells, and feels like an upscale version of regular sandwich bread. The flavor is great, and the bread is soft and yummy right out of the bag. Toasting it makes the flavor even better, and the bread also makes great french toast. If you are in the market for a gluten-free bread that is delicious right out of the bag, this one is for you. It is about $3.99 a loaf at the local Lowes Foods store (in the frozen food section), and it stays fresh for a couple of weeks once it's thawed."", 'I discovered that I was gluten-intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good-tasting wheat-free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I\'ve tried has been beyond disgusting.  I\'ve been to health food store after health food store and haven\'t found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela\'s Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law\'s bread machine and fired up a loaf.<br /><br />Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you\'ve eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It\'s a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn\'t have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!<br /><br />I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as ""real"" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you\'re the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the ""On"" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent-tasting bread for us gluten-intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela\'s Products!!', 'This mix saved my life.  After being diagnosed with celiac disease, I tried all the ""great"" gluten-free bread machine recipes I could find (I am awful at baking bread by hand).  They were all uniformly and unequivocally TERRIBLE.  They were dense, didn\'t rise properly, caved in at the top or sides, etc etc etc.  They also all tasted very gluten-free.<br /><br />This mix, though is wonderful.  It rises, sticks together very well for a fluffy gluten-free bread (it still has the tendancy to fall apart if not toasted), makes wonderful croutons and stuffing, browns properly and only occasionally caves in a little bit.<br /><br />Things I have learned with this mix that help it a great deal:<br /><br />1. Let the loaf sit in the bread machine for at least 20 minutes after it stops baking. (I have the standard Oster bread machine that was popular when the bread machine rose to popularity.)<br /><br />2. Make it with rice milk.  To me, cow\'s milk and almond milk taste funny with this recipe.<br /><br />3. Let it cool for a good long while, it is very moist and will fall apart if you try to slice it immediately.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this bread as much as I do!']"

The meat at Costco is better and much cheaper.  The potatoes were good, and quite convenient.  The chocolate cake was pretty good, and with a short time in the microwave was like an expensive ""molten chocolate"" sort of cake from a restaurant.  The stuffed sole was disappointing.  It was OK, but no better than what I\'d expect at a cheap restaurant.  In short, Omaha Steak food is less expensive than good restaurant food, but also less convenient and not nearly as good.  It\'s more convenient than getting everything from a grocery store, but much more expensive and not as good.

To experience this product you do not want to water it down in any way.<br /><br />I mixed 1/2 vinegar, 1/2 olive oil with some minced garlic and onions, a little salt and pepper. It made a nice thick dressing that was to die for spooned over mixed greens. Also, my concoction did not diminish the viscosity or the flavor of the vinegar in any way. When using this product you want the vinegar to always be at the center of the taste experience.<br /><br />The biggest negative for this product is that once you try it there is no going back. And, at $45 a bottle it is priced like liquid gold. Heck, I do not spend that much for a 1/5th of quality Bourbon! I find myself checking the level in the bottle every time I open the cabinet. This stuff is a real treat to be experienced.<br /><br />I am pretty frugal with how I spend my money. I never thought I would spend 45$ on a bottle of vinegar. But this is not vinegar as you and I traditionally know vinegar. Now, it is hard to imagine not having a bottle of this in our cupboard for those special occasions.', 'Excellent balsamic vinegar,  dark and syrupy,  with deep flavor.  Not the authentic balsamic vinegar,  but the price is right.', 'okay, what this product is: this is a ""Crema"" di Balsamico.<br /><br />What it is not: regular balsamic vinegar, or *aged* balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />Okay, so what is a ""crema?""<br /><br />Aged balsamic vinegars are naturally thick. 12 year old balsamic approach syrup, and 25 year old definitely do. This comes from the aging process and natural evaporation. It also makes thick, syrupy, aged balsamic vinegars VERY EXPENSIVE. A good 25 year old bottle from the Carandini family will set you back $150 to $200.<br /><br />Regular balsamic vinegar flows like thick vinegar, but can make for a thin salad dressing if you do not want to use mustard or another emulsifier (although high quality walnut oil will emulsify with regular balsamic).<br /><br />So, sometimes you want a thick dressing that clings to your salad leaves (think bitter escarole).<br /><br />You want the balsamic taste, a thick consistency, but don\'t want $25 dollar-per-serving salad dressing.<br /><br />You then have two choices: 1) reduce regular balsamic over low heat until it is thickened. The pros are it is thicker, the cons are this method looses a lot of flavor and complexity from the heat.<br /><br />Choice two (2): is to use a ""crema.""<br /><br />Cremas combine regular balsamic vinegar with other thickening ingredients such as high quality starches (in minute quantities) and atomized grape flesh solids. It gives you the thick consistency you want, all the punch of balsamic vinegar, a bit more smooth tasting balance, and at a price you can afford.<br /><br />This Crema is made by the Emelio Carandini family of Modena, who make the best balsamic vinegar in the world (if you ever get a bottle of their ""Noe"" you\'ll never want to use anything else ever again).<br /><br />This is the highest quality crema on the market, made by the best balsamic vinegar family in the business. No, it is not aged and reduced balsamic...but it also does not cost over $100. This is an intelligent high-quality compromise product that does very well what it aims to do.<br /><br />An excellent product re-sold under the ""Earthly Delights"" private label but coming from the best people in the business. A tremendous value.']"

Recommend it to all my friends...', 'I love Republic of Tea\'s rooibos teas. I bought mine at Whole Foods.  Republic of Tea\'s teas quality rival Numi\'s but I think this rooibos tea is even higher in quality than Numi\'s since you get ""double"" the dose of usual rooibos so that you get a deeper taste of rooibos and you can see and smell the red rooibos powder lightly dusted off the teabags.  And the packaging is compact and attractive, great as a gift.  What I like about rooibos is that it doesn\'t have that yucky tasting flowery herbal taste of hibiscus, rosehips, etc that teas like Celestial Seasoning are notoriously known for.  Also, you don\'t have to feel like Superman trying to break into their teabags (like Numi\'s) since there are no enclosed individual protective packets around each tea bag.  Rooibos teas are nutty and mellow in taste.<br /><br />Rooibos is healthy, great for skin ailments and calming for anxiety/nervous tension (which is why I love it so much), and it has no caffeine.  I double my health with it by adding raw unprocessed honey but it\'s really already slightly sweetened so that you don\'t need a lot of sweetener.  The tea is even better iced.  If it weren\'t so expensive, I\'d get it more often but am forced with the lower cost alternative with Twining\'s rooibos teas which has a more ""hay"" taste/smell.', ""This is a great tea.

In fact, Rooibos tea has been found to have as much as 50 times more SOD than Green Tea. It also has other anti-oxidants not found in other teas.<br /><br />The effect of free radicals (a by-product of normal cell function) in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the anti-oxidants in Rooibos tea.<br /><br />Rooibos tea is completely pure and natural, as it contains no additives, preservatives or colorants. It is a soothing drink for people on a calorie-restricted diet, without adding kilojoules.<br />Rooibos tea is also strongly recommended for people suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension. Rooibos tea contains no caffeine and therefore has a soothing effect on the central nervous system. Rooibos tea is also low in tannin and therefore does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.<br /><br />Rooibos tea has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants. Rooibos tea also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach ulcers and constipation.<br /><br />Furthermore, rooibos tea also supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and especially fluoride, needed for the development of strong teeth and bones. It contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid, which promotes healthy skin and magnesium which is necessary for a healthy nervous system.<br /><br />Rooibos tea has a soothing effect on the skin, relieving itching and certain skin irritations like eczema, nappy rash and acne when directly applied to the affected area.""]"

Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a ""spice flavor not found in nature,"" they claim, so I guess there\'s no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I\'d rather have the natural version since it\'s natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea.

I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable.

The product did not live up to it's claim of repelling the raccoons from the treated area and I will be returning the remainder of this bottle for a refund.<br /><br />I'm giving it 1 star only because zero was not an option."", 'This kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.<br /><br />I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.<br /><br />The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can\'t get them into rock hard dry ground, but that\'s not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you\'ve probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.<br /><br />The kit is supposed to come with 200\' of 1/2"" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100\'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I\'d trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200\' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.<br /><br />The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.<br /><br />I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you\'re glad to have the option.<br /><br />The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It\'s a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.<br /><br />The hook for the gate isn\'t quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you\'re counting on the fence never being touched, so it\'s not a big problem.<br /><br />The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.<br /><br />This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence.']"

This mix has a delicious flavor with just the right amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Good additions to the mix include 1/2  to 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans and/or 1/2 to 1 cup of chocolate chips (mini-chips do not sink to the bottom of the pan.)  The finished bread freezes well which is helpful if baking in advance. The pumpkin icing recipe on the box is quite good. It requires some of the canned pumpkin (the entire can isn't needed for the mix), butter, milk, vanilla, cinnamon and powdered sugar.<br /><br />When I can find Dassant mixes I buy them and here's why. The Dassant ingredient list includes six items - enriched bleached flour, sugar, spices, salt, leavening and either soybean or canola oil. The list on a name brand spice cake mix I had in my pantry has 18 ingredients including partially hydrogenated soybean oil, corn syrup, artificial color and a number of unpronounceable items. I love to bake from scratch but sometimes I don't have time. Using a mix is a time saver but I still want it to taste free of chemicals and be as natural as possible.

I bought the already cooked sliced chicken in the meat section to add in. Pros of the meal: 1) cheesy 2) flavorful - I didn't need to add any other seasonings. It didn't require any salt, pepper, or whatever else your tastebuds may call for. 3) The servings were plentiful. It serves a family of four perfectly. There were only 2 in my house, but we had enough for lunch the next day. 4) The leftovers were just as tasty as the first night of eating it. The only con that I can think of is that the meal uses dried broccoli, which has a strong sweet taste. If you are able to substitute it with fresh broccoli or even frozen broccoli, that would balance the taste better."", 'I had a feeling when I opened the box that this wasn\'t going to be as good as it looked in the picture. Included therein were a package of orzo-style pasta, a big pouch of Velveeta cheese, an envelope of seasoning and another small, flat envelope marked ""broccoli florets."" Inside the latter envelope was a tablespoon or so of grey-green flakes which may have at some point been broccoli, but were nothing you could call a floret in this stage of it\'s existence. Now, I know this is packaged food and it\'s not going to be anything to write home about, but honestly, I don\'t think the company should be allowed to claim that this dish contains broccoli. A few green-gray flecks can hardly be called a vegetable.<br /><br />Preparation was relatively easy. I browned the chicken I was adding (the box calls for 1 pound, which in my case consisted of two chicken breast halves, halved again so there were four pieces total.) To the thoroughly cooked chicken I added 2.5 cups of water, the seasoning packet and the pasta. During the course of cooking the pasta swells up and it was a nice texture and consistency on its own. After simmering the mixture a few minutes I added the packet of alleged broccoli florets, of which there were far too few to affect the look, let alone the taste, of the concoction. Stirring continuously because the pasta wanted to stick to the bottom of the pan, I found the mixture was taking on a slimey look as the moisture evaporated a bit. The final step was to stir in the packet of cheese. In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit I\'m not a Velveeta fan, but my father loves it and I fed this to him, too. The cheese was bright orange goop and per the instructions I mixed it into the dish hoping it would taste better than it looked. It didn\'t. More importantly, my dad, who LOVES Velveeta and any other kind of American cheese dish, didn\'t like it. The prepared dish had a strange texture that wasn\'t appetizing at all. He\'s not a picky eater, and if he won\'t eat it, you can bet it\'s damned near inedible. I can\'t recommend this product.', 'Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Chicken and Broccoli works best with a well prepared kitchen.  First, I recommend using at least a 12"" diameter fully covered skillet.  I replaced the portion of chicken with turkey breast cut up into pieces and cook until done.  Next, I add in the 2 ½ cups of water, seasoning, one quarter stick of butter and pasta.  Bring it all to a boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer for the next 7 minutes.  Finally add in the yummy Velveeta cheese sauce pouch and stir in the tasty goodness!<br /><br />Coming from Louisiana, I prefer a little more spice in my meals and found myself adding just one more ingredient to get that unique Cajun flavor!  Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of Southern Cajun Seasoning Low Sodium to give your meal a real spice kick without all that salt.<br /><br />We enjoyed eating this meal.  Out of a group of just three people who ate this while watching a New Orleans Saints game, there was none left 30 minutes after it was prepared.  The broccoli florets gave the meal a real interesting vegetable taste and the pasta was just right.

It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp.

I give it 4 stars because Dove is a wonderful soap, and this is a bit more on the manly scent side, but not enough.  Some men don\'t like a strong smelling soap so this may be great for them, but unfortunately for my guys they want a stronger smelling cologne in their soap.', 'As I get a bit older, my skin does not seem to hold up so well to the cold dry winters anymore.  Since I hit my 30\'s, I usually use Dove Moisturizing Body Wash (if you are like me, I refer it to Dove in the white bottle) and to be honest, I have had lackluster results with it.  It helps quite a bit, but it never seemed to do a great job of moisturizing.<br /><br />I agreed to try Dove Men + Care (I guess this will be dubbed Dove gray) and to be honest, expected similar results.<br /><br />After using it for a few days, I have to say my skin does feel better than with the standard Dove in the white bottle.  The dry, burning, itchiness feeling I get in winter really seems to have diminished.<br /><br />The scent that it leaves behind is pretty long lasting and is what I would describe as a musky scent.  Strangely, what my skin smells like after I wash and what the soap smells like in the bottle do not seem to have the same scent to me.  My wife calls the scent nice (she is the most important judge after all), but I thought it was just so-so.  The scent is not bad and is nothing I would find embarrassing, I just was not overly impressed by it.  I do like the fact that the scent lasts a lot longer than other body washes I use.  I think it lasts quite a bit longer than Old Spice High Endurance body wash.<br /><br />Also to me a big improvement over Dove white is the lather.  The Dove in the white bottle does not have a great lather, but Dove Men + Care is easy to lather up in a pouf and a little soap seems to go a long way.<br /><br />The only thing I really did not like about the product was the name.  Minor point, but I think Dove Men + Care is too wordy.<br /><br />Overall, I do like how this makes my skin feel after only a few days.  Most likely, this will be my new ""winter"" body wash as I really did like how it makes my skin feel.']"

I also like the regular and Raspberry Lemonades, though the Raspberry seems to have changed formula for the worse over the past year or so.

I wasn\'t sure if I was supposed to swallow my saliva so I just held it in my mouth the whole time then spit when I was done.<br /><br />First, the lemon wedge.  I took a bite and my eyes lit up.  It tasted like a lemon that someone had rolled in powdered sugar.  It was sublime.<br /><br />Next I tried the Lime wedge.  Again, you taste the lime but it tastes like a lime candy.  I started laughing.<br /><br />The Star Fruit tasted almost like a soft apple.  It was sweet and had a mild crunch.  I ended up eating about 4 slices of that.<br /><br />I mixed the vitamin c powder into a glass of water.  When I took a mouthful, I naturally expected a very sour taste.  Instead, it tasted like a light lemonade.  I was so curious that I actually stuck my finger directly into the Vitamin C powder and tasted it.  It tasted like a Pixi Stick.<br /><br />The Greek yogurt tasted tart still, but had a very pleasant sweet taste.<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the sour cream.  It tasted like a really creamy frosting...hard to explain but I had 3 teaspoons of it!<br /><br />The Brussels sprouts tasted like chestnuts.  I really enjoyed their flavor.<br /><br />The Tabasco sauce almost tasted like a V8 juice EXCEPT the tip of your tongue can still sense the heat.

I now realize why people shake it onto their tongue in the videos.<br /><br />The red wine vinegar still smelled very much like vinegar as I brought it to my mouth.  I had a hard time with that one.

But they\'re gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there\'s no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance\'s dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don\'t have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.']"

I handed one to him and it was love at first bite.  They are quite expensive at the pet store, so I was thrilled to see them here on Amazon for such a bargain (compared to pet store prices.)  With all the hype about pets getting sick from products made in China, I was also happy to see that these Cadet Bull Sticks are made in Brazil...

I\'m rating it 4 stars now because the last couple of recent batches I\'ve gotten, have been very inconsistent in size...  most of them pieces around 6 - 8"" long instead of 12"" long, however, they do package them to equal out to be 1 lb. worth of bull sticks, albeit some are short and very thin, some are very short and thick, some are long and thick.  (Resisting inappropriate joke...;)  My other disappointment with these latest batches is that the price has gone up about $5 from earlier in the year, but it\'s still a nice value compared to the pet stores.  Like someone else has mentioned, they also don\'t seem to grab the attention of my now 14 month old, 45 lb. keeshond like they used to.  The last 2 batches, he\'ll leave it lying around awhile, but will finish it in about an hour when he does feel like chewing it.  I wonder if/what they changed at the manufacturer?

When I was pregnant my favorite snack was toasted whole wheat bread with Smuckers Reduced Sugar raspberry jam slathered on it.  Yum!  The subsequent child is now also a big lover of this jam!  This jam tastes like you went out into the raspberry patch and picked your own.  It reminds me of freezer jam, more taste and less sugar.  I love and appreciate raspberries and I love and appreciate this jam!!!', 'In short, Little Scarlet is the one of the most delicious jam I\'ve ever eaten. I used to disregard strawberry jam in favour of raspberry as I usually found strawberry to be cloyingly sweet and short on flavour. LS is certainly the exception.  It\'s intensly flavoured and, for me, only rivaled by the homemade jam my friend\'s Mother in Law makes from wild strawberries picked by hand in Prince Edward Island.<br /><br />I first tried Little Scarlet @ 10 yrs ago on my first trip to London at a *very* fancy hotel\'s, outrageously expensive, High Tea. Everything at that tea was exceptional (as one would hope after taking out a mortgage to attend) and, even then, this fabulous jam stood out.  I inquired, expecting to be told that it was hand-made, in single pot quantities, by magical fairies ;-)  I was shocked to learn that it\'s a commercial jam and could be purchased retail at the gourmet shops in Fortnum & Mason, Harrods, Selfridges and other such fancy-ass shops.<br /><br />My next stop after tea was Fortnum & Mason thinking Little Scarlet would be an ideal souvenir for friends & family. I should have braced myself for the sticker shock.  Even back in 2003, with the British Pound at almost $2.25 Canadian, LS commanded a price of over 7 Pounds.  I\'d never seen such an expensive little jar of jam but it was my first time in England and I was feeling high-falootin (how does one spell \'fallootin\'?) so I scooped up several jars to wow the folks back home with.  Thank goodness the airlines hadn\'t yet cut back so severely on luggage weight!<br /><br />No big surprise, everyone LOVED it and the search began to find LS in Canada & the States.  It turned out that it is produced in small batches (although, disappointingly, not by magical fairies)and its\' availability varies drastically depending on the size of the year\'s crop at Tiptree.  Entire years have since gone by where I couldn\'t source a drop of it by any means :-(<br /><br />I ended up bribing coworkers from our London office to be buy it up for me whenever they could find it at UK shops (yes, at any price).  They\'d then send it over to me with the next business traveler heading back \'across the pond\' to Corp Head Office in Canada (where I was located).  I\'d send the traveler home with a king\'s ransom in Canada Grade A Light Maple Syrup (a big hit ""over\'ome"" where corn syrup is the standard)or a fistful of cash, whichever they preferred.<br /><br />I was delighted (and truly shocked) recently to find this gem of a jam at a new gourmet shop in, of all places, Niagara Falls NY!  At only US $14 a jar it was an relative steal and I stocked up :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />I just enjoyed my breakfast toast & jam (on yesterday\'s Ace Bakery baguette, yummo!) and felt the need to extol the virtues of the Little Scarlet. If you\'re on the fence about spending big bucks for a little jar of jam I recommend treating yourself to the LS - it\'s very much a treat indeed.', ""I tried this jam based on a review I read on Amazon.  I thought such rave reviews merited a try.  I was not disappointed.  It was GREAT. Loaded with fresh summer berries the jam looks like something you'd see in a picture perfect photo in some great foody magazine.  The taste is equally appealing reminding me of some homemade treasure Grandma pulls out of her pantry or something served in a fine french bistro.<br /><br />We've tried it on toast, scones, pancakes, even vanilla ice cream.  We had 6 weeks of company this summer and I ordered a case for us all to enjoy.  Had to order another case before the last of my company left.  Most everyone wrote down the name so they could order it for themselves.<br /><br />Now after raving about this jam I have to let you know that I'm not a huge fan of jam but my family does enjoy it so we always have jam on hand.  Usually strawberry jam is their preference, in fact. But... THIS JAM made ME want to make toast for breakfast just so I could slather some on buttered toast.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />My only question is this... any thoughts as to what one could do with many cases of darling empty jam jars?  I think this could be a great country craft waiting to happen.""]"

Second order from Martinis, and so far every olive has been perfect.  Good sized olives with a consistently very firm, meaty texture, not a mushy one in the bunch.  Olives come in a tasty but very salty brine and wine vinegar mixture.  Right out of the keg you can't eat too many because of the salt, but the flavor is very good.  For regular eating we do the following.  We take a portion of the olives, drain and rinse them, and transfer them to another container and fill with cold water.  We let it sit for several hours and change out the water. We repeat this a couple more times with a final wash that is left overnight to 2-days with something added to season and spice them up.  Use dried red pepper, fresh jalapenos or whatever.  Then they are well drained and put in a separate container with more fresh sliced peppers and covered with olive oil.

Fill the jar with olive oil.  5. Cover with the lid and keep out of direct sunlight and store on your counter top. Do NOT refrigerate.<br /><br />These will keep for months. The taste is quite good with just a touch of heat from the peppers.  Small jars of olives prepared this way make excellent hostess gifts.  After the olives have been consumed, I strain the remaining olive oil and use it for cooking. The taste of the olive oil flavored with the peppers adds another layer of flavoring to most dishes.  The olive oil is also great for dipping.', 'I love the container these come in much more then the bagged olives sold at Amazon, but the taste is not nearly as good as those olives.

Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope."", ""Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see."", ""Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.""]"

I have had good results so far with this manufacturer.<br /><br />I sprout my wheatgrass in soaking trays and transfer it to plates when it\'s too big for its container. This type seems to start sprouting more slowly than other wheatgrass seeds I have sprouted in the past, including commercially available ""cat"" grass which I found to be chemically treated. I wonder if the chemicals affect the speed of sprouting. It takes maybe five days for this variety to be ready for plate growing, as opposed to three or so of the other brand. However, patience seems to pay off - in return for a lengthier sprouting time, this grass seems tastier than others I have had - almost sweet. Its stems are hardy and don\'t \'flop\' over. When I juice the leaves I get results similar to buying a wheatgrass shot at WholeFoods - tasty, so I believe the manufacturer\'s ""chemical free"" labeling. Chemically grown wheatgrass is known to taste distinctly bad. I have also taken to using the young sprouts in salads because of their sweet taste.<br /><br />Another reviewer said this product was ""hard"" - I\'m not sure in what way, unless there is some other growing method which isn\'t encouraged by the slow start to germination I have experienced.

I purchased The Sprout House Hard Wheat for Wheatgrass Sprouting Seeds about a month ago, and I can already see this is going to last me for awhile.  I have a recycled wheatgrass container from one of those grocery stores, and each batch takes less than 1/4 cup of wheat grass seeds to grow the same amount.  I'm literally growing the same amount of grass for pennies.  It's so easy to grow this for my cats, that I'm thinking about buying a manual juicer and growing some for us as well!<br /><br />The only down-side to this bucket is how hard it was to get the lid off!

I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn\'t care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That\'s right, they don\'t care whether we\'re happy with the product, just that it\'s fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I\'ll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients).

Now I don\'t need a cosmic level calculator. I can return to the healthy spice of life in full measure... at least in uses of my beloved mayo.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon and Wilderness Family,<br />Linda Shelnutt', ""I ordered this item because some acquaintances on a cooking forum were raving about Dukes Mayo being far superior to Best Foods/Hellman's Mayonnaise.  I can't get Duke's here in California, so I ordered four 48oz. jars!!  This is a tasteless excuse for mayonnaise!!  The flavor is just plain flat.  I'll be sticking to Best Foods Mayonnaise from now on.

When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive."", ""I love mushrooms.

In a previous life I was married to a brit who brought back a muesli recipe and habit from living in Germany.  She in turn imported the stuff to central Texas and introduced me to it.  It was not love at first bite.  This stuff is somewhat of an acquired taste.  Back then making the muesli involved planning and long (75+ miles) trips to the nearest organic whole foods store before the ingredients could be assembled.

Note that different soak times give different textures.  Dried or fresh fruit garnishes a bowl beautifully.  I add no sugar to the cold cereal. And pat myself on the back for being so wholesome.  On the other hand, every now and then I'll do a cooked batch.  The difference between the two is as different as jerky from steak.  Totally different flavor and I find the hot version is begging to be gussied up with dried fruit (cooked in with the cereal), a healthy(!) dollop of butter and brown sugar, even just a wee pinch of salt, and just a little milk to cool and thin the porridge.  What a treat!!<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I don't find that I get tired of the taste, or find it too bland like other reviewers have commented.

Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn combines all three of these ingredients into one, with a sweetness level that makes this product more like candy than popcorn.<br /><br />When consumers think of caramel corn, the first product that comes to mind is Cracker Jack and this Snackwell product does, indeed, remind me of this classic snack food product. The difference is that Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn goes a step further by adding fudge to the mix. There isn't a ton of fudge- it is only lightly drizzled- but it certainly present and it adds more flavor to an already tasty product.<br /><br />This Snackwell food tastes great, but if I had to register one complaint, it would be the same complaint that many other reviewers have already made: there is an awfully high amount of sugar in each serving. The individual serving packs are nice because they allow easy convenience and only a small amount of the snack, helping consumers avoid over-consumption. But even with such a small serving size of only one ounce, there are still eighteen grams of sugar per pack. If you can eat only one pack, you should be okay, but I will be the first to admit that it is very easy to eat two or three packs at a time. Multiply this by eighteen grams of sugar per serving and you are bound to experience a case of sugar overload.<br /><br />Snackwell makes this product with only a minimal amount of fudge. I would have liked it better with even more fudge, but at the same time, I realize that any additional fudge would likely spike the sugar content even higher. So, as much as the chocolate flavor would be enjoyable, I am happy that Snackwell kept its ambitions under control.<br /><br />Snack foods are a regular part of life for me and I am happy to have tried this Snackwell product. I like the flavor profile very much and while I agree with others who voice concerns over the sugar content, this product isn't much worse than other sweet snacks. As long as one keeps their consumption in check and limits themselves to only a package or two, they should have no problem or guilt as they enjoy the sweet caramel and chocolate taste of this popcorn product.""]"

I have never eaten peanut butter, but have always been envious of the idea of peanut butter...a quick, tasty, healthful food that goes with a multitude of other things and is found in recipes everywhere. Unfortunately, since peanuts = death for me, I put it out of my mind. Then one day I found this Sunbutter. Not only is it peanut and tree nut free, it explicitly states on the label that it is manufactured in a facilty that is peanut and nut free. A good thing, because it was with fear and trepidation that I opened and then tasted sunbutter...I mean, it looks and smells just like peanut butter. Obviously, I can't say if it tastes like peanut butter, but I can say that it is DELICIOUS! I have been gleefully eating it on crackers, with apple slices, on sandwiches, and out of the jar straight. It is a major food discovery for me, and I am oh so thankful."", 'We became Sunbutter fans about five years ago, after our daughter was diagnosed with a peanut allergy.  I tried Soynut butter (gross!) and all the nut butters we could find had peanut warnings on them.  Sunbutter is a safe alternative.  I use it for baking (sunbutter krispies, sunbutter cookies), cooking (Thai dishes), and for just eating.  Check out Sunbutter\'s website for tips on baking, as you will need to decrease backing soda in recipes, so food doesn\'t turn green. We all love it.  Most of our friends, who have tried it, have switched to Sunbutter also.  I can\'t tell a difference and it has opened up endless possibilities, enabling our family to feel ""normal"".  When baby #2 came along, we used it ""safely"" from age 1-3, when most doctors tell people to avoid peanuts.', 'I have two older kids that used to love peanut butter.  One actually ate peanut butter 2 or 3 times a day.  That was their main staple.  But then I had a third child who was severely allergic to peanuts & nuts.  I tried all the other peanut replacement products out there and they were terrible.  The Soy Nut butter tasted awful and was very gritty.  But then we found Sunbutter.  Oh my gosh!!! It tastes better than peanut butter and has the same consistency and health benefits of peanut butter.  My two older kids easily switched to Sunbutter and love it.  We use both the creamy and crunchy versions -- both excellent.<br /><br />In addition, I use Sunbutter to make cookies (peanut butter cookies made with Sunbutter) and Chinese Sesame Noodles -- without the sesame oil and seeds (my daughter is also allergic to sesame) and use Sunbutter.  It is excellent!  I love, love, love this product.  I love the fact it needs no refrigeration and is nutritious.']"

The variety of almonds they use are fat, slightly rounded and a little bit small.  Small is plentiful and small is good in this case; these aren't the big mild-flavored things that show up in your bridge mix.  Instead, these almonds are so rich with the Amaretto flavor, that almond note of pure almond extraxt - that you'd swear that you smell the almonds before you crunch them.  They aren't broken bits of almonds either - that's for lesser manufacturers.  These are whole, fresh and delicious.  the most striking thing is how many of them turn up in each package - tremendously impressive in a world where other companies wave a single almond at the vat of cookie dough and call it good.<br /><br />The cherries make for a tender chewy punctuation between all the crisp, wonderful biscotti and crunchy, flavorful almonds.  The biscotti itself is slightly smoother than most, slightly denser than many of the crumbly bars offered up in premium coffee shops, yet the bite, the mouthfeel, all perfectly craggy, crunchy and satisfying.<br /><br />The Coffaro's traditional recipe is easy on the sugar, which is another factor that lets the texture and the almonds' flavor shine through as the top stars.

It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin\' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn\'t just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn\'t tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn\'t contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I\'ve never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided', 'I absolutely love the taste of this jerky.

I gave this item 6 stars, but amazon only allows 5. Pop em in the fridge, eat them for breakfast, eat them for lunch, eat them for dinner, eat them for snacks. These cans of tasty pineapple chunks are like an explosion of citrusy pineapple heaven.', 'Ummm.. I open the pop top can -- then I eat one or two chunks -- then I drink the pineapple juice and sloowly finish off the rest of the delectable chunks. Yes I am eating right out of the can -- very informally - and there is usually an opened can of chicken chunks next to me at my hidden cubicle at work where I eat my lunch. Chicken and pineapple -- to me, a great informal lunch. Of course when I am home, everything gets mixed in a pot, with cooked white rice and heated to perfection. Or maybe the Dole Pineapple Chunks are slated for a cake, upside-down or right-side up -- Everything (almost everything, maybe not liverwurst) goes better with Dole Pineapple. They are always, fresh, juicy, and tasty.', 'So I have a confession to make. I don\'t like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They\'re too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn\'t on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it\'s wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don\'t like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I\'m glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I\'m praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we\'ve found ourselves with. Maybe I\'ll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. ""That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy."" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I\'d be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I\'m not too sure of this one, I\'m going to have to try it with strawberry, but it\'s got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don\'t think this is one I\'ll be stocking up on, but I don\'t think I\'ll be forcing it on my friends either. I won\'t have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I\'ll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don\'t think I\'m enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it.']"

I just started this tea yesterday with 2 cups and today 1 cup so far. For about a month I have been consistently pumping a little less than 8 ounces over 2 pumping sessions at work, but today I pumped a little over 10 ounces, pumping the same amount of time! Just those two extra ounces is huge for me. As others mentioned I am also a regular tea drinker so its not the extra fluid intake. I like the taste, but it has anise in it which some might not like. Hope this tea keeps my supply up!', ""My background: I'm a working mom who exclusively breastfeeds.  I know my infant is receiving plenty of breastmilk when he nurses at home.  My downfall is pumping at work.  I only get 3 pump sessions with less than 15 minutes for each one.  I usually pump at work before I start, during my lunch break (and eat lunch at my desk) and about 2 hours before I drive home.  My commute is a bit more than an hour each way. I was struggling hard to fill four bottles of 4 oz of breastmilk a day that my son drinks.  Three for the daycare and one at home for my husband to use until I can make it home. We had just wiped out my barely there frozen supply and I was spending the weekends pumping like mad when my infant wasn't nursing to build that extra supply back up. I had been trying the Mother's Milk Herbal tea, which seemed to only give me the runs and cause massive gas in my infant.  I didn't appreciate running to the bathroom all the time, but my infant got a kick out of tooting all day with the tea.<br /><br />I can't remember where I read about the lactation cookies before, but I was getting at wits end, especially when I started to pump even LESS.  I guess since my son is at the 6 month mark, or my body might be trying to kick start ovulation, I don't know and it was driving me crazy.  I tried extending my sessions at work and taking hits on annual leave to pump enough.  My infant doesn't tolerate formula well and we didn't want to supplement him with the expensive formula, so I figured these cookies would be work a try.<br /><br />What to expect:  I started by eating two cookies a day.  Don't expect to eat one of these cookies and double your pump amount that evening.  I tried eating two cookies a day and by the end of the third day I had the 'man, my boobs really hurt' kinda sensation.  I was at home, not at work, so I let my son nursing and then successfully pumped an extra ounce after he was done.  I thought to myself 'damn, that was awesome'.  It was.  I now had some extra milk.  When work started, I noticed a slight increase.  I usually pump anywhere from 3-5oz a session.  When I ordered milkmakers cookies, I was leaning more towards pumping 3 oz a session and spending about 20 min with a Lactina double pump to do so.  It's now been almost a full week since I started having two cookies a day and now I'll be sitting at work and I know it's time to pump because I have the slight engorgement feeling, something I haven't had since the first few weeks of initially breastfeeding.  And, how do I say this without sounding crass....when I pump, more comes out faster....so instead of taking 20 minutes to just get 4 oz, in about 10 minutes I'm pretty much done pumping, even though I keep on going. My supply while pumping at work has gone from around 3 oz lately to just about 4 oz, and sometimes topping 5 oz again.<br /><br />The extra bonus is first thing in the morning when my infant falls back asleep after feeding I can manage to pump an additional 1-3 oz depending on how hungry he was when he nursed.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty darn impressed.  My husband even agrees the money toward the milkmaker cookies is worth it, and yes, he's tried a bite of a cookie and it's pretty tasty too.  We're not big fan of formula, so we figure the cost of a 1 month supply of cookies would cost the same as one and half canisters of the speciality formula we'd have to buy IF we went the formula route.<br /><br />I'm happy I can continue to breastfeed my son and I can pump enough at work each day to have bottles ready for him at daycare and when my husband picks him up.  I DO try and get my son to 'top up' before I drop him off in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside is the oatmeal and brewers yeast in these cookies gives me gas, but I'd rather have mild gas than the runs like the Herbal tea gave me."", 'I am an exclusively pumping mother. When I first started pumping I may have pumped 1/2 ounce to 1 ounce. After drinking the tea for a dew days, I began pumping 1 1/2 ounce to 3 ounces per pump. This tea helped my milk production.']"

My boys are allergic to wheat/gluten, dairy/beef, eggs/chicken, shellfish, peanuts, soy, corn, sesame, mushrooms, maple, oranges and cinnamon so they are very restricted vegans eating a high raw and organic diet.  Hemp is wonderful for protein, omegas, and healthy fats!<br /><br />At first I had subscribed and saved to this 8 oz (pack of 3) organic hempseed for $16.75.  I bought 10 (30 packs) to start. That\'s about 70 cents per ounce. I like the portable packs for traveling, visiting grandparents, snacking out of.  An ounce is 3 TBSP which is one serving.<br /><br />I bought quarts of commercial hemp milk for years, Manitoba Harvest, Living Harvest and Pacific (Pacific Vanilla was our favorite.)  I did the Amazon s/s program.  But when I bought my Blendtec Wildside blender I started thinking ""I CAN MAKE IT MYSELF!""<br /><br />Here\'s what you need:<br />a high performance blender like VitaMix or Blendtec is best<br />Shelled hempseed, 8 ounces<br />purified water<br />a nut milk bag for straining (sold on Amazon for $8)<br />a sweetener like honey, agave, dates, or brown rice syrup<br />vanilla if you like<br />Real salt or sea salt of high quality<br />two 78 ounce frigoverre glass jars with tight sealing hermetic lids (sold on Amazon for $10-15) or equivalent<br /><br />Make 1 gallon of hemp milk by adding 1 quart of pure water and the an entire 8 oz package shelled hempseed to a blender bowl and blend on medium about 2 minutes (soaking 15 minutes first is optional).  Line the inside of one of the jars with the nut milk bag (hold the bag so it won\'t fall in) and pour the cream into the bag.  Squeeze it through the nut milk bag into one of the jars, twisting the bag to extract, then pour the strained cream back into the blender.  I added 1 teaspoon Real Salt, 1 tablespoon organic vanilla, 4 tablespoons raw agave, OR Lundberg brown rice syrup , OR a handful of high quality dates to sweeten a bit.  After blending again (more blending if using dates) pour equal amounts of the flavored cream into the two 78 ounce jars.  Add pure water to fill the jars. Seal the hermetic lid properly.  They keep for a few days and I can gently shake the jar before opening and serving to reincorporate.<br /><br />This way makes 16 - 8 ounce servings of my own hemp milk, the same strength as commercial hemp milk.  Just calculating the hemp in each 8 ounce bag gives totals of 1360 calories, 108g fats, 20g carbs, 16g fiber, 84g proteins.  Making 16 eight ounce servings in a gallon means each serving (just the hemp numbers) is 85 calories, 6.75g fat, 1.25g carb, 1g fiber, 5.25g protein. I used the average of Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest brand nutrition facts for these figures.  As ready as packaged quarts of hemp milk are now I no longer have to carry in heavy cases of premade milk and throw away all those containers.  And it only takes me 5 minutes to make milk.<br /><br />Compared to a commercial quart this milk is fresher, it tastes \'greener\', smells like cut grass but doesn\'t taste it, and the milk is still very \'nutty\' in flavor, just as smooth and creamy.<br /><br />You can make a heavy cream to drink or use in smoothies by doubling the hempseed OR halving the water. ""Banana Milk"" with hemp cream or hemp milk and a banana is awesome. Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest have recipes on their websites.<br /><br />I have started buying the Manitoba Harvest 25# tubs of shelled hempseed.  It is not labeled organic.  But, as hempseed needs no chemicals to grow wonderfully, and it is NON GMO, eco farmed without insecticides or pesticides I have no problems with it not having a label. I store it in the deep freeze in divided portions.  The savings on Amazon is incredible.  The 25# tub is about $136 on the s/s program.  It is 500 oz and costs 27 cents per ounce. So if I use 8 ounces to a gallon of milk I\'ve spent $2.16. That\'s $.54 per quart! I used to pay $4 per quart at Whole Foods!<br /><br />Please study hemp and its benefits over dairy.  Of course you may have thought you needed dairy for the protein and calcium.  I grew up in Iowa, I was taught that, I was a huge milk drinker.  I had even seen the reality of dairy/beef processing but ignored it.  When breastfeeding (the best milk I could give my son) he was spitting up/vomiting every feed I realized the urgent need to stop drinking it.  Now at 5 years just a splash of skim milk on his arm will give him red boils and blotches.  Soy milk is out too, even if he could drink it hemp is better.  We do sometimes have homemade organic brown rice milk and organic NON GMO gluten free oat milk.<br /><br />I hope you explore hemp milk yourself!  You will save money, and no driving to the store for every gallon of milk you drink, or recycling or waste, plus think of the health benefits.  Share what you know with others so we can become growers and not just consumers of this wonderful superplant.']"

For me, i feel like i got much more energy and so much better tasting.  These taste as good as any gummi candy out there.  Sometimes during the week i'll open a package and eat a few every day before my workout, and i really notice the extra energy towards the end of the workout."", 'Heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast.  An avid hiker, I have used other energy gels with limited success.  Taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb, they provide the extra boost you need.  The chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy.  Highly recommended.', 'These energy chews have a great flavor, will give you good energy before or during a workout, and are a reasonable price. I would recommend this to any endurance athlete such as a cyclist, runner, triathlete, etc. Strength Training and Sports Nutrition for Cycling']"
